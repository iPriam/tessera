# Tessera

An operating system built on the Linux kernel with a userland of its own.

Tessera is not a distribution. It takes the kernel as given and replaces
everything above it: there is no init system inherited from elsewhere, no shell
assumed to exist, and no package manager. The userland is written in
[Kira](../../kira-projects/klf-kira).

## Where it is

Booting, on its own userland. PID 1 is a Kira program that reaches the kernel
through raw system calls — `mount`, `write`, `wait4`, `ppoll`, `sync`, `reboot`,
`execve`. Each one lowers to a `syscall` instruction in a wrapper of its own: 29
`syscall` sites in the emitted object, one per call Kira's table knows this
program makes.

The SDK a Tessera program builds against is Kira and RIDL and nothing else
([roadmap/14](roadmap/14-tooling-and-ports.md),
[roadmap/18](roadmap/18-components.md)). No component compiles C, ships a C
header or binds one: libraries reach each other through their `.ridl`
contracts. The one native library is Vulkan, the one Ember's Vulkan backend
links for the GPU; there is no Dawn. WebKit WPE is the one other exception, under
the WebKit exception in `AGENTS.md`.

What remains is not what the userland says, but what it carries with it,
described below. Every program is dynamically linked, so every image with Kira
code in it carries the loader and the C library too.

## What it trusts

Tessera has no root of trust. Nothing checks the bootloader, the kernel or the
initramfs before they run: there is no secure boot, no measured boot and no
hardware key, and a virtual machine on a Mac offers none to build one on. The
system volume is read-only squashfs, so nothing running on Tessera can change
it; it is not verified, so a volume changed outside Tessera boots as though it
had not been. `dm-verity` is off and no root hash is computed. The system is
trusted only because of where its image came from.
[roadmap/13](roadmap/13-security-and-updates.md) states the threat model and
what closes this gap.

Applications are checked, but not against Tessera. A disk image may carry an
Ed25519 signature from any key. PID 1 refuses an image whose bytes do not match
its signature, and tells the owner which key signed an image it has not seen
before, or that an image is not signed at all; a second request goes ahead. No
key is built into the system, none is required and none is privileged, so the
project has no way to refuse software someone else made. A signature says who
made an image, not whether to trust them.

## Architectures

aarch64 is the target Tessera is for. x86_64 is carried alongside it for about
two years, as the compatibility architecture, and every change is expected to
work on both until that support is dropped.

There are two build hosts. On x86_64 Linux, aarch64 is cross-compiled, and its
kernel and initramfs build here; booting it is a separate matter, because QEMU's
TCG emulation of aarch64 produces no console output at all from the kernel on
this host, so `kira build boot -arch aarch64 -test` cannot be run here and the
x86_64 boot test is the one that proves anything. On Apple silicon it is the
other way round: aarch64 is the native architecture, it is compiled without a
cross toolchain and runs under Hypervisor.framework with nothing translated, and
x86_64 is not built at all — a Mac has no Linux cross compiler to build it with.

## Building

On Windows, everything builds inside a Fedora WSL2 distribution. Source lives on
the Windows filesystem where the editor can reach it; build artifacts live on the
WSL ext4 filesystem under `~/.tessera-build`, because a kernel tree built over the
9p mount is roughly an order of magnitude slower.

From a Windows shell:

```powershell
.\tessera.ps1 boot -arch x86_64 -test         # build, boot, assert userland was reached
.\tessera.ps1 boot -arch x86_64 -dev          # boot interactively
```

aarch64 cannot be booted on an x86_64 host: QEMU's TCG emulation of aarch64
produces no console output from the kernel here.

From inside WSL, `kira build` takes the same commands.

On macOS aarch64 is the only architecture:

```sh
kira build boot -arch aarch64 -test          # build what changed, boot, check
kira build boot -arch aarch64 -desktop       # boot to the desktop in a window
```

`setup` on a Mac needs the Xcode command line tools installed, and arranges three
things. The compiler and linker are the LLVM bundle Kira pins and `knvm`
installs, not Homebrew's — Homebrew's `llvm` ships no linker at all, and its
`lld` is a second formula moving on a version stream of its own, so a kernel
built with `LLVM=` would link with an `ld.lld` from a different release than the
clang that produced the objects. The Linux C library the userland links against
is staged out of Debian's `-arm64-cross` packages, because Darwin's own can never
serve a Linux program whatever the architecture. The two glibc headers the
kernel's host tools include and Darwin has no equivalent of — `<elf.h>` and
`<byteswap.h>` — are staged where those tools will find them.

Homebrew still provides GNU make, coreutils, bc, wget, xz and QEMU. Those are
build tools rather than parts of Tessera, and no version of them ends up in the
image.

## What this needs from Kira

An installed Kira compiler, and the Kira checkout beside this one for one
package.

Kira is a language of the Kira Language Framework. `klf` is the framework
binary; the compiler is a driver built from the `.klfd` definitions in the
`klf-kira` checkout and installed as `kira` under `~/.klf`:

```sh
klf build ../klf-kira/languages/kira -o kira     # the native driver
cd ../klf-kira && knvm binstall                 # build, register and install it
```

`/root/.klf/bin/kira` is a **launcher**, not the compiler. It reads
`~/.klf/toolchains/kira/current.toml` and dispatches to the channel named there,
which on this host is `dev/0.1.0`:

    channel = "dev"
    version = "0.1.0"
    primary = "kira"

`kira --version` reports what the launcher selected, so it reports the installed
channel rather than the checkout's own working state. `TESSERA_KIRA` names a
compiler outright and skips the question. The build package compiles with the
toolchain the nearest `kira-toolchain.toml` pins, else the one knvm selected.

No component imports a kernel package: libtessera's `app/Backend/Linux/` is
the only code that declares a system call, and every other component reaches
the kernel through LibTessera. An installed toolchain carries its own
Foundation, so `TESSERA_KIRA_FOUNDATION` is gone. The LLVM the kernel and the
guest GPU stack are built with is the framework's own: the newest bundle under
`~/.kira/toolchains/llvm` that carries clang, which is the one the framework
links with. `TESSERA_LLVM` names a different one.

A cross target needs a sysroot holding that target's C library, because the LLVM
bundle the framework builds with carries a compiler and none. It reads the
sysroot out of the environment: `KLF_SYSROOT_<TRIPLE>` first, with the triple's
dashes as underscores, then plain `KLF_SYSROOT` for the common case of one cross
target. The build package passes the staged sysroot as the second. Two names
because a machine building for two targets has two C libraries and neither is a
sensible default for the other, while a user with one cross target should not
have to spell the triple. Without one the build fails naming the target and the
variable to set:

    kira: error: building for `aarch64-unknown-tessera` on `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` needs a sysroot
    holding that target's C library; set KLF_SYSROOT_AARCH64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_GNU or KLF_SYSROOT to it

A Linux program links `-lgcc_s`, so the sysroot has to carry the target's GCC
runtime too, and the framework checks for it before the link instead of passing
`--unwindlib=none`. A sysroot is a package set the user installs, so an
incomplete one is theirs to fix and the message names the missing file; the flag
that hides it produces a binary needing a `libgcc_s.so.1` the guest does not
have, and the user finds out at boot rather than at build. `kira build setup`
arranges it on both hosts — see `HANDOFF.md` §0 for the Fedora case, where the
distribution's own cross sysroot has the static half of the GCC runtime and not
the shared half.

Tessera is a target of its own, `aarch64-unknown-tessera` and
`x86_64-unknown-tessera`, with the Linux kernel behind it. It is never the host,
so every build of the userland takes a sysroot; on a Linux host of the same
architecture that is `/`. C compiled outside Kira takes the Linux triple behind
it, which `arch_linux_target` names.

The system calls the stage-1 handover needs — `chdir` and `chroot`, which
together move PID 1 out of the initramfs and into the system volume — were once
a patch carried against Kira's syscall table. They are upstream, along with the
rest of what the userland reaches the kernel through, and nothing has to be
applied to a Kira checkout before Tessera builds.

## Layout

| Path | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `kernel/VERSION` | The pinned kernel version, and the only place it is written |
| `kernel/config/` | Config fragments merged over each architecture's defconfig |
| `patches/` | Patches to upstream projects (Mesa, QEMU, virglrenderer, Linux) |
| `roadmap/` | The design documents, including the LibTessera and DeviceKit specifications |

This repository assembles Tessera. Each component (init, libtessera, devicekit,
mosaicdisplay, the Dynamic Platforms and the rest) is its own repository in
`~/Dev/tessera-projects`, beside this one, and the scripts build whatever each
checkout holds. `build/app/Components.kira` names them.

## The kernel pin

Currently Linux 7.2, from the mainline series.

Mainline is a deliberate choice over the newest longterm: it carries the
smallest set of known vulnerabilities at any moment. The cost is that mainline
has no backport stream, so staying current means moving the pin forward to each
new release rather than receiving fixes on the one that is pinned. The pin is a
single line in `kernel/VERSION`; every script reads it from there.

## What the Kira userland can and cannot do yet

Kira cross-compiles to Tessera on aarch64. That was the blocking constraint and it is
gone. `kira build` takes `--target` and names its output with `-o`:

```sh
kira build --target aarch64-unknown-tessera -o /path/to/init ../init
```

`--sysroot`, `--relocation-model` and `--linkage` are gone, and so is the fixed
`.kira-build/<triple>/main` an older compiler wrote: `-o` says where the finished
executable goes, which is why `scripts/build-initramfs.sh` writes straight into
the staging tree instead of copying from a directory it then has to look up.

Every program is dynamically linked. There is no `--linkage static` to ask
otherwise: the framework links the target's C library rather than folding it in,
and nothing on the command line turns that into a static link. What it means is
visible in the binary — the loader path the ELF header carries, and the three
libraries it needs:

```console
$ file /root/.tessera-build/out/aarch64/rootfs/init
init: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, ARM aarch64, dynamically linked,
      interpreter /lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1

$ readelf -d .../init | grep NEEDED
libm.so.6   libc.so.6   libgcc_s.so.1
```

So an image carrying Kira code has to carry the dynamic loader and the C
library, at the path the ELF header names: `/lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1` on
aarch64, `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` on x86_64. A binary whose interpreter is
missing boots to "no working init found", which reads like an absent file rather
than an absent loader. `build/app/Architecture.kira` names the loader, and the
`initramfs` and `system-volume` steps check every ELF file's interpreter.

What is not settled is what such a binary *contains*. Kira's own standard
library is Kira, but the runtime beneath it is Rust, and it brings the Rust
standard library. Tessera's PID 1 leaves 43 libc symbols undefined and eleven
`_Unwind_*` that `libgcc_s` answers, and the glibc it dynamically links is a few
megabytes beside it in the image. A hand-written `_start` making the same write
through a raw syscall is 1.5 KB.

That gap is Tessera's central question rather than an optimization: an OS that
says no to libc cannot inherit one through its language's runtime. What stands
between here and a self-contained Kira userland, in increasing size:

- the framework links the target's C library rather than folding it in, so the
  dependency is a link-line fact rather than something a flag turns off
- the runtime's optional surfaces are not optional; a program that never opens a
  database still references one
- the runtime is `std`, and a freestanding userland needs it not to be

Nothing above was a reason to wait, and PID 1 is Kira today. Measured on the
things themselves: `init` is 1.2 MB on x86_64 and 1.3 MB on aarch64, and the
initramfs it rides in is 4.0 MB and 4.4 MB compressed.
