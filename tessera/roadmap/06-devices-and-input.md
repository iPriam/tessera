# 06 — Devices and input

How Tessera knows what hardware it has, and how a keypress becomes something an
application sees.

## Where it stands

The display card and framebuffer fallback still have fixed paths. Input no longer
does: MosaicDisplay enumerates `/dev/input`, opens each event node, and asks its
`EVIOCGBIT` capabilities before deciding that it is a keyboard. The services boot
proves this with `keyboard discovered by EVIOCGBIT at /dev/input/event0`. A
second display on `card1` is still invisible, and there is no hotplug.

`CONFIG_VIRTIO_INPUT` and `CONFIG_INPUT_EVDEV` are on because the `virt` board
has no PS/2 controller.

## Enumeration

Hardcoded paths are correct for exactly one machine, and Tessera runs on one
machine today. The cost of that shows up the first time there are two of
anything.

`/dev/input/` holds `event0`, `event1`, … with no indication of what each is.
The answer is `EVIOCGBIT`, an ioctl that reports which event types a device
emits: a thing that reports `EV_KEY` with keyboard keycodes is a keyboard, a
thing that reports `EV_REL` is a mouse, a thing that reports `EV_ABS` with
`ABS_MT_*` is a touchscreen. That is how every input stack on Linux does it and
there is no shortcut.

Similarly `/dev/dri/card*` — open each, ask for its resources, take the one with
a connected connector.

Both need `getdents64` ([05](05-storage-and-state.md)) and both need
`EVIOCGBIT`, which is another ioctl whose request number is computed rather than
remembered.

**This belongs in the display server**, not in PID 1 and not in a library: it is
the process that owns the display and the input, and enumeration is how it finds
them.

## Input

### The pipeline

    evdev  →  display server  →  focus  →  the client that has it

The display server opens every input device, reads events, decides who they are
for, and forwards them over the protocol ([08](08-display-server.md)). A client
never opens an input device. That is not a security decision so much as a
correctness one — two processes reading the same evdev node both get every
event.

### What arrives

`struct input_event`: eight bytes of seconds, eight of microseconds, then `type`
and `code` packed into the word at offset 16, and `value` at 20. Twenty-four
bytes, always a whole number of them. `EV_KEY` is 1, `EV_REL` is 2, `EV_ABS` is
3, `EV_SYN` is 0.

`EV_SYN` is the one that gets skipped and should not be. It ends a group of
events that happened together, which is what makes a mouse's two axes one
movement rather than two, and what lets a keyboard report a modifier and a key
in the same instant. **Events are batched between syncs and delivered as a
batch.**

### Keycodes are not characters

A keycode is a position on a keyboard. `30` is the key where `a` is on a US
layout and where `q` is on a French one. Turning one into a character needs a
keymap, and a keymap is a real piece of work: layouts, modifier levels, dead
keys, compose sequences.

Tessera's honest first answer is **one built-in layout, US, compiled in**, with
a note that this is a placeholder. The second answer is XKB keymaps, which are
the only sane source of layout data and which mean either linking `libxkbcommon`
(a glibc-carrying program can) or parsing a subset in Kira.

What must not happen is a keymap invented ad hoc, because every application will
then inherit its gaps.

Modifier state — shift, control, alt, and the lock keys — is the display
server's, tracked across events and sent to the client with each key so that a
client never has to reconstruct it.

### Repeat

The kernel repeats keys when it feels like it (`value == 2`). A UI usually wants
its own repeat rate and its own delay, and wants repeat to stop when focus
moves. The display server should synthesise repeat from a timer and ignore the
kernel's, which needs `timerfd` ([02](02-kernel-and-syscalls.md)).

### The pointer

`EV_REL` with `REL_X`, `REL_Y` and `REL_WHEEL`; buttons as `EV_KEY` with codes
from `BTN_LEFT` up. The display server accumulates motion into a position,
clamps it to the display, and draws a cursor.

**The cursor is a compositor problem, not a client one.** Two ways to draw it: a
DRM cursor plane, which is a hardware overlay the display never composites into
the frame — free, and moves without a redraw — or a quad drawn on top of the
scene, which always works. virtio-gpu's cursor plane support should be checked
before relying on it; the fallback is not expensive.

### Touch, and everything else

`EV_ABS` with the multitouch protocol. Not needed for a desktop and not worth
building until there is a machine with a touchscreen.

## Hotplug

Devices appearing and disappearing arrive as messages on a netlink socket
(`NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT`). That needs the socket family
([04](04-ipc.md)), and it is the reason netlink is on the list at all.

Without it, a keyboard plugged in after boot does not exist. On a VM that is
academic. On hardware it is the first thing anyone notices.

The minimum version: listen, and on an `add` or `remove` for a device in the
`input` or `drm` subsystem, re-enumerate. Nothing clever, and no attempt to be
`udev` — there are no device permissions to set and no rules to run, because
everything runs as root and there is nothing to run.

## Network

`CONFIG_VIRTIO_NET` and `CONFIG_INET` are on and no userland has ever opened a
socket. Once the socket family exists ([04](04-ipc.md)), a network stack is
mostly configuration: an address, a route, a resolver.

**Later, but no longer optional.** A person installs applications Tessera did not
build ([12](12-apps.md)), and while sideloading from a volume is the first path
and should never become second-class, most software arrives over a network.

What does not follow is a browser ([01](01-principles.md) says no) or a
system-wide package manager ([13](13-security-and-updates.md): the system updates
as a whole volume). What is needed is smaller: an address, a route, a resolver,
and the ability to fetch a file. A sealed system with a network is a larger
attack surface than one without, and the answer is that the system's own software
does not listen on anything.

## Sound, USB, RTC, power

None configured. Each is a decision rather than an oversight:

- **Sound** matters the first time an application wants to make a noise, and
  ALSA is a large surface. Not on the critical path.
- **USB** is a controller and a hub for the sake of devices virtio already
  provides. On real hardware it is unavoidable; on the `virt` board it is
  avoidable and avoided.
- **RTC** — the machine currently does not know what time it is. That is
  invisible until something shows a clock or writes a timestamp.
- **Power** — battery, lid, sleep. All of it is meaningless in a VM and all of
  it is table stakes on a laptop.

## Checkpoints

- [x] Input devices are found by asking what they emit rather than by path.
      MosaicDisplay enumerates `/dev/input` and selects a keyboard through
      `EVIOCGBIT`; the boot test still routes the injected key through it.
- [x] The pointer moves a cursor on the display. MosaicDisplay draws the
      cursor into the composed picture where there is no cursor plane, and
      moves it with every pointer; the multi boot moves the virtio mouse onto
      a Stage Manager strip picture at 89,184 and asserts the press lands on
      that surface (`a press landed on a surface without focus|surface: 2`).
- [x] Modifier state is tracked and delivered with each key. The multi boot
      sends Shift-C and asserts `a key arrived with a modifier held|client: 2|
      key: 6|state: "pressed"|text: "C"|shift: true`.
- [x] Key repeat comes from a timer, at a rate Tessera chose. MosaicDisplay
      drops the kernel's repeats and arms a timer on its loop's port: 500 ms,
      then every 33 ms (`Input/Repeat.kira`). The multi boot holds B for
      1250 ms and asserts `a key repeated|client: 2|key: 5`.
- [x] A keycode becomes a character through a keymap that is named rather than
      improvised. `Keymaps.us` (`Input/Keymap.kira`) gives each key its text,
      which the key carries on the wire; the multi boot asserts `text: "a"` at
      client 3.
- [x] A device plugged in after boot is noticed. MosaicDisplay watches
      DeviceKit's registry for input devices (`Input/Hotplug.kira`); the multi
      boot plugs a USB keyboard in and pulls it out and asserts
      `found a keyboard|keyboards: 3` and `a keyboard went away|keyboards: 2`.
      The Devices service sees a USB speaker come and go the same way.
