# 16 LibTessera

The system interface specification, v0.1, as this tree implements it. The draft
([PDF](LibTessera-System-Interface-Specification-v0.1.pdf)) exported LibTessera
to C. This edition exports it over RIDL only: no header, no
C names, no C calling convention. §25 records what `libtessera` does
and where it departs from the draft.

Version 0.1 · target CalVer 2026.10 · status: design draft for review

LibTessera is the sole system interface of TesseraOS. It is written in Kira, exported over RIDL as the module `LibTessera`, and linked by every system service and every Kira program. A consumer in another language reaches it through bindings generated from the RIDL surface. It is the surface of a full operating system. The kernel underneath — Linux today, XNU or a native kernel later — is an implementation detail that no consumer can observe through this API.

Reading guide: §1–5 are the ground rules every domain obeys. §6–20 are the domains, each with its objects, structs, calls, rights, errors and backend notes. §21 is the kernel backends and the enforcement ledger. §22 maps consumers onto the calls. §23 is the complete call index. §24 lists the decisions still open. §25 is the implementation in this tree.

## 1. Principles

1. Everything is a handle. Every kernel or system resource is an object reached through a process-local, unforgeable, typed handle carrying rights. There are no integer file descriptors, no PIDs used as authority, no global names.
1. Rights, not identity. What a process may do is what its handles allow plus what its entitlement set unlocks. Nothing checks "who are you" at call time; the check happened when the handle was minted.
1. Completion, not blocking. Any operation that leaves the process (disk, network, a service, hardware) is asynchronous: it is submitted with a (port, key) and produces exactly one Completion packet. Synchronous consumers wait on a port.
1. No ambient authority. A process starts with exactly the handles listed in its Startup message. There is no working directory, no environment variables, no inherited descriptor table, no root namespace.
1. Not POSIX. No libc, no errno, no signals, no fork, no absolute paths, no select. Tessera-native code never touches any of these; the POSIX tier is a separate, notarized, time-limited world.

1. Kernel-agnostic by construction. No call, struct, flag or error names a kernel concept. Each object has a semantic definition independent of any backend, and the backend section proves each backend can implement it.
1. Numbers are Kira's `Number`. Every count, size, time, offset and code crosses this boundary as `Number`, or `UNumber` when it is never negative. LibTessera converts to the fixed widths a kernel, a device or a wire format needs inside itself; no caller writes a fixed-width integer. Records written into a caller's `Buffer` and the IPC wire format keep their stated widths, offsets and little-endian byte order.
1. Explainable failure. Every error is a structured value: code, subsystem, and a detail word that for policy failures is an audit reference the user can be shown.
1. Additive evolution. Declarations carry CalVer availability (@introduced, @deprecated). Nothing is ever removed or reshaped; new behaviour is a new call or a flag whose zero value preserves old behaviour.
1. Mechanism here, policy in services. LibTessera never shows UI, never decides policy. Entitlements, grants, pickers and prompts live in system services reached through channels; LibTessera provides the objects and the transport.

## 2. Conventions

### 2.1 Types at the boundary

The boundary is the RIDL surface `kira build --emit ridl ../libtessera`
writes. That file is the contract: field order, widths and enum values are what
it says, and `klf ridl bindgen` turns it into a consumer's declarations.

| Draft | RIDL | Width | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `UInt8` … `UInt64` | `UNumber` | 16 | plain integers that are never negative |
| `Int8` … `Int64` | `Number` | 16 | plain integers that may be negative |
| `Bool` | `Bool` | 1 | |
| `Address` | `RawPtr` | 8 | virtual address in the calling process |
| `Size`, `Instant`, `Duration`, `Deadline`, `Key` | `UNumber` | 16 | byte counts and nanoseconds; a deadline of 0 polls and `U64` max never expires |
| `Handle<T>` | `Handle { raw: U64 }` | 8 | untyped; 0 is invalid; the call checks the object type |
| `Rights` | `Rights { raw: U64 }` | 8 | §3.3 |
| `Signals` | `Signals { raw: U32 }` | 4 | §3.4 |
| `Buffer` | `Buffer { address: RawPtr, length: UNumber }` | 24 | caller memory |
| `Error` | `TesseraError` | 16 | §4 |
| `Completion` | `Completion` | 64 | §5.2 |
| string | `String` | | UTF-8, never NUL-terminated, within the stated limit |
| array | `[T]` | | a RIDL array; the count travels with it |

Enums the surface declares (`ErrorCode`, `Subsystem`, `ObjectType`,
`CompletionKind`, `Qos`, `Clock` and others) cross as RIDL enums. Option sets
and the remaining enums cross as `U32`, each case a function answering its value
(`lockExclusive()`, `infoVersion()`).

RIDL lays out the structs that are parameters and results, and the draft's
`reserved` fields are not carried. Records the library writes into a caller's
`Buffer` (the `*Info` topics, `Datagram`, encoded vectors) keep the draft's byte
layout and offsets.

### 2.2 Naming

- `Domain.verb` is exported as `domainVerb` in module `LibTessera`: `Memory.map` is `memoryMap`, `Debug.break` is `debugBreak`. This document keeps writing `Domain.verb`.
- `File.read` and `File.write` are `fileReadAt` and `fileWriteAt`. Kira's Foundation defines a `fileWrite` of its own, and the overload would mangle the exported name.
- Types are PascalCase. Constants are `let`s in a namespace named after what they are values of: `Rights.read`, `Signals.peerClosed`, `SystemDirectory.applications`. The contract carries them, and a reader gets the value itself, not a call.
- Verb vocabulary: create (new object from nothing), open (handle to an existing resource), close, read / write, get / set, wait, signal, cancel, list, lookup, info.

### 2.3 Export shape

Every public declaration of `libtessera` is part of the surface.

- `-> Result<T, Error>` stays a `Result<T, TesseraError>`. There are no out-pointers.
- A call with nothing to return answers `TesseraError`; `code == .Ok` is success.
- A call with several results returns one struct (`HandlePair`, `MessageSize`, `ReceivedMessage`).
- `Process.exit` and `Thread.exit` do not return.
- Availability (`@introduced`) is not carried yet. The whole surface is 2026.10.

`scripts/build-component.sh libtessera <arch>` builds the shared library
`LibTessera.framework/LibTessera` and the surface `LibTessera.ridl` into the
component's roots. Each consumer imports it from the SDK, where Kira reads
the contract in place ([18](18-components.md)).

### 2.4 Synchronous vs asynchronous calls

A call is synchronous if it never leaves the process and never waits on hardware: handle-table operations, memory mapping, clock reads, port/channel/ event operations, thread control, wait/wake on address (bounded by a deadline the caller chose). Synchronous calls return Result<T, Error> and are complete when they return.

A call is asynchronous if it touches disk, the network, a device, or a system service. Asynchronous calls take port: Handle<Port>, key: Key as their last two parameters, return Result<Void, Error> for the submission only (validation errors, missing rights), and then deliver exactly one Completion to port carrying key — success, failure, or Cancelled. Calls documented as multi-shot deliver repeated completions until cancelled or the object is closed, and one final completion with Cancelled.

Rules for in-flight operations:

- Memory referenced by a submitted operation (buffers, address structs) must stay valid and unmodified until its completion is observed.
- Closing the object handle cancels its in-flight operations; they complete with Cancelled.
- Closing the port drops all pending completions; in-flight operations still run to completion but their results are discarded.
- Port.cancel(port, key) cancels every in-flight operation on that port with that key.

Thread-port convention. Synchronous consumers lazily create one Port per thread, submit with key = 0, and call Port.wait(port, 1, INFINITE). That is the entire cost of "sync" — there is no synchronous mode in LibTessera.

### 2.5 Versioning and ABI stability

- Availability is per declaration: @introduced("2026.10"), @deprecated("2029.01", reason:). Deprecated symbols keep working for at least four years after deprecation, then move to a compatibility shim that still resolves.
- No symbol is ever renamed, removed, or changes signature. A changed shape is a new symbol; the old one stays.
- Info structs are versioned by topic: Object.info(handle, topic, version, out); a new field means a new topic version, and older versions keep being served.
- Options and flags: the zero value of every flag is the original behaviour; new flags are appended.
- System.info(.Version) reports both the OS CalVer and the LibTessera ABI CalVer so consumers can gate on either.

### 2.6 Threading, reentrancy, errors

- Every call is thread-safe. Handles may be used from any thread of the owning process concurrently.
- Calls never allocate on the caller's behalf except where a returned handle is documented; callers own every buffer.
- Calls never call back into the caller. There are no callbacks anywhere in the ABI.
- No call is ever "interrupted": there are no signals. Interrupted is not an error code.

## 3. Objects and handles

### 3.1 Handle value

A handle is a UInt64. The value 0 is INVALID and is never a valid handle. Non- zero values are opaque; internally they encode a table index and a generation counter so a closed handle cannot be confused with a later one. Handles are process-local names: the same object seen by two processes has unrelated values. The maximum number of open handles per process is reported by System.info(.Limits) (default 65 536).

### 3.2 Object types

```
  enum ObjectType: UInt32
    None         = 0
    Port         = 1       completion queue                                      (§5)
    Event        = 2       signalable object                                     (§9)
    EventPair    = 3       two linked events with peer-death                     (§9)
    Timer        = 4       clock-driven completion source                        (§8)
    Channel      = 5       bidirectional message + handle transport              (§10)
    Memory       = 6       pageable memory object, mappable                      (§6)
    Thread       = 7       thread of execution                                   (§7)
    Process      = 8       address space + handle table + threads                (§11)
    Job          = 9       tree node owning processes and child jobs             (§11)
    Node         = 10      namespace capability: a file or directory             (§13)
    File         = 11      data handle for a file's bytes                        (§13)
    Watch        = 12      change-notification stream on a Node                  (§13)
    Endpoint     = 13      network endpoint                                      (§15)
    Stream       = 14      device data stream (sensor, audio, camera, haptic) (§16)
    WakeLock     = 15      power management lock                                 (§18)
    Presence     = 16      the app's right to interact with the user             (§14)
    // 17–255 reserved for Tessera; 256+ reserved for future backends
```

### 3.3 Rights

Rights is a 64-bit set. Bits 0–15 are generic and have the same meaning on every object type; bits 16–31 are type-specific; bits 32–63 are reserved. RIGHTS_SAME (UInt64.max) means "the same rights as the source" and is only valid in Handle.duplicate.

```
  Duplicate     = 1 << 0      may create another handle to the object
  Transfer      = 1 << 1      may be sent through a channel
  Read          = 1 << 2      read bytes / receive / observe state
  Write         = 1 << 3      write bytes / send / mutate state       (fs: Update)
  Map           = 1 << 4      may be mapped into the address space
  Execute       = 1 << 5      may be mapped executable
  Signal        = 1 << 6      may assert user signals
  Wait          = 1 << 7      may wait on signals / receive completions
  Inspect       = 1 << 8      may read info topics
  Manage        = 1 << 9      may destroy, kill, resize, configure, set policy
  SetProperty = 1 << 10       may set name / attributes
  Enumerate     = 1 << 11     fs: List
  Create        = 1 << 12     fs: Create
  Delete        = 1 << 13     fs: Delete
```

Traverse     = 1 << 14   fs: lookup into child directories Grant        = 1 << 15   Presence: may request grants and present pickers

The five filesystem capabilities from the permission model map exactly: Read → Read, List → Enumerate, Create → Create, Update → Write, Delete → Delete, plus Traverse for entering subdirectories. They are independent bits: Create does not imply Write or Delete; Read does not imply Enumerate.

Default rights when an object is created by the calling process are Duplicate | Transfer | Read | Write | Signal | Wait | Inspect | Manage | SetProperty plus the type's natural extras (Map for Memory, Enumerate | Create | Delete | Traverse on a Node the process is entitled to). Handles minted by a service carry exactly what the grant allows. Presence handles never carry Transfer or Duplicate.

### 3.4 Signals

Signals is a 32-bit set. Bits 0–15 are defined per object type, bits 16–23 reserved, bits 24–31 are user signals (USER_0 … USER_7) settable on Event and EventPair only.

```
 READABLE     = 1 << 0    something to read / a completion available
 WRITABLE     = 1 << 1    can accept a write without ShouldWait
 PEER_CLOSED = 1 << 2     the other end of a pair is gone
 SIGNALED     = 1 << 3    Event/Timer fired
 TERMINATED   = 1 << 4    Thread/Process/Job ended
 ERROR        = 1 << 5    object is in an error state (Endpoint, Stream)
 OVERRUN      = 1 << 6    Stream: data lost
```

Per type: Channel READABLE | WRITABLE | PEER_CLOSED; Endpoint READABLE | WRITABLE | PEER_CLOSED | ERROR; Thread/Process/Job TERMINATED; Event/EventPair SIGNALED | PEER_CLOSED | USER_*; Watch READABLE | PEER_CLOSED; Stream READABLE | WRITABLE | ERROR | OVERRUN; Port READABLE.

### 3.5 Generic handle and object calls

All synchronous.

```
 Handle.close(handle: Handle<Any>) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Invalidates the handle. In-flight operations on it complete with Cancelled. The object is destroyed when its last handle in every process is closed (and, for Process/Thread/Job, when it has terminated). Errors: InvalidHandle.

```
  Handle.closeMany(handles: [Handle<Any>], count: UInt32) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Closes all listed handles; continues past invalid ones and reports InvalidHandle if any were.

```
  Handle.duplicate(handle: Handle<T>, rights: Rights) -> Result<Handle<T>, Error>
```

Requires Duplicate. rights must be a subset of the source's rights or RIGHTS_SAME. Errors: InvalidHandle, AccessDenied (missing Duplicate or superset requested).

```
  Handle.replace(handle: Handle<T>, rights: Rights) -> Result<Handle<T>, Error>
```

Atomically returns a new handle with the (reduced) rights and invalidates the old one. Does not require Duplicate — this is how a process narrows its own authority before passing a handle on.

```
  Handle.info(handle: Handle<Any>) -> Result<HandleInfo, Error>
```

```
  struct HandleInfo (32 bytes)
      type:       ObjectType (u32)   @0
      reserved0: u32                 @4
      rights:     Rights (u64)       @8
      objectId:   u64                @16   stable within the process's lifetime;
  equal for handles to the same object
      reserved1: u64                 @24
```

```
  Object.info(handle: Handle<Any>, topic: InfoTopic, version: UInt32, out:
  Buffer) -> Result<Size, Error>
```

Requires Inspect. Writes the topic struct for the requested version. Returns BufferTooSmall with the required size in Error.detail. Topics are listed per object type in their sections (ProcessInfo, NodeInfo, EndpointInfo, …).

```
  Object.setName(handle: Handle<Any>, name: Buffer) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Requires SetProperty. Diagnostic name, ≤ 64 bytes UTF-8, shown in tooling. Errors: InvalidArgument.

```
  Object.waitAsync(handle: Handle<Any>, signals: Signals, options: WaitOptions,
  port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

```
  enum WaitOptions: UInt32    Once = 0 (default), Repeat = 1, Edge = 2
```

Requires Wait. Posts a Completion of kind Signal when any of signals is asserted; result0 = signals asserted at delivery. Once delivers one packet and disarms; Repeat re-arms until cancelled (multi-shot); Edge only reports transitions. This is the universal readiness mechanism — the equivalent of every poll / epoll / kqueue use, expressed as completions on the same port as everything else.

```
  Object.signal(handle: Handle<Event|EventPair>, set: Signals, clear: Signals) ->
  Result<Void, Error>
```

Requires Signal. Only user bits and SIGNALED may be set/cleared. Errors: AccessDenied, WrongType, InvalidArgument.

## 4. Errors

```
 struct Error (16 bytes)
   code:        ErrorCode (u32)   @0     0 = Ok
   subsystem: Subsystem (u16)     @4     which layer produced it
   flags:       u16               @6     bit0 HAS_AUDIT_REF, bit1 HAS_BACKEND_CODE,
 bit2 RETRYABLE
   detail:      u64               @8     audit reference, required size, backend
 code, or 0
```

Success is a `TesseraError` whose `code` is `Ok`.

```
 enum Subsystem: UInt16
   LibTessera = 0, Kernel = 1, Namespace = 2, Presence = 3, Launcher = 4,
 Devices = 5,
   Network = 6, Display = 7, Power = 8, Audit = 9, DeviceKit = 10
```

```
 enum ErrorCode: UInt32
   Ok                    = 0
   // argument / handle
   InvalidArgument       = 1      a parameter is malformed
   InvalidHandle         = 2      handle is 0, closed, or not owned by this process
   WrongType             = 3      handle is not the required object type
   AccessDenied          = 4      handle lacks the required right
   NotEntitled           = 5      process lacks the required entitlement (detail =
 audit ref)
   OutOfRange            = 6      offset/length/index beyond the object
   BufferTooSmall        = 7      detail = required size
   NameTooLong           = 8
   InvalidPath           = 9      path violates §13.2 (detail = byte offset of the
 violation)
   Unsupported           = 10     valid request the backend/device cannot honour
   // state
   NotFound              = 20
   AlreadyExists         = 21
   Busy                  = 22     resource in use (e.g. locked, mapped, streaming)
   BadState              = 23     object not in the state the call requires
   ShouldWait            = 24     non-blocking call would block; wait for the
 relevant signal
   Timeout               = 25     deadline passed
   Cancelled             = 26     operation cancelled
   PeerClosed            = 27     other end of channel/eventpair/endpoint gone
   // resources
   OutOfMemory           = 30
   NoSpace               = 31     storage exhausted
```

QuotaExceeded       = 32    job policy limit hit (detail = which limit) TooManyHandles      = 33 // namespace NotDirectory        = 40 IsDirectory         = 41 NotEmpty            = 42 ProtectedNode       = 43    operation forbidden on a protected root (detail = audit ref) GrantExpired        = 44    detail = audit ref GrantRevoked        = 45    detail = audit ref // presence NoInteraction       = 50    InteractionToken missing, spent, or expired NotFrontmost        = 51    requesting surface is not front-facing NotMainProcess      = 52    caller does not hold Presence UserDenied          = 53    the user said no (detail = audit ref) // network ConnectionRefused   = 60 ConnectionReset     = 61 Unreachable         = 62 AddressInUse        = 63 AddressNotAvailable = 64 // devices DeviceLost          = 70 DeviceBusy          = 71 FormatUnsupported   = 72 Overrun             = 73    stream data lost Underrun            = 74    stream starved // catch-all Internal            = 90    backend failure; detail = backend code (flags.HAS_BACKEND_CODE) // 100–139 reserved for DeviceKit ([17](17-devicekit.md) §5)

Policy failures (NotEntitled, UserDenied, ProtectedNode, GrantExpired, GrantRevoked) always carry an audit reference: a 64-bit id into the central grant/ request log kept by the Audit service, so the failure can be explained in Settings instead of collapsing into an opaque error.

## 5. Ports and completions

A Port is a completion queue. It is the only way asynchronous results, signal notifications, timer expirations, and user-posted packets reach a process. A port has no owner thread; any thread may wait on it, and multiple threads waiting on one port form a work pool.

### 5.1 Calls

```
  Port.create(options: PortOptions) -> Result<Handle<Port>, Error>
  enum PortOptions: UInt32     None = 0
```

```
  Port.wait(port: Handle<Port>, out: [Completion], max: UInt32, deadline:
  Deadline) -> Result<UInt32, Error>
```

Requires Wait. Dequeues up to max completions, blocking until at least one is available or deadline passes. Returns Timeout with count 0 when the deadline passes; deadline = 0 polls. Completions from one object are delivered in submission order; across objects order is by completion time.

```
  Port.post(port: Handle<Port>, packet: Completion) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Requires Write. Enqueues a user packet (kind is forced to User). Returns ShouldWait if the port holds more than its capacity of pending user packets (default 65 536) — user packets are bounded so a process cannot exhaust memory through its own port.

```
  Port.cancel(port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<UInt32, Error>
```

Cancels every in-flight asynchronous operation and armed waitAsync targeting this port with this key. Each cancelled operation still delivers its completion, with Cancelled. Returns how many were cancelled.

### 5.2 Completion packet

```
  struct Completion (64 bytes)
      key:       u64                @0    the submitter's Key
      error:     Error (16)         @8    Ok, or why the operation failed
      kind:      CompletionKind u32 @24   what kind of operation completed
      flags:     u32                @28   bit0 MORE (multi-shot: further packets
```

will follow) result0:     u64              @32   primary result (bytes transferred, new handle, signals, …) result1:     u64              @40   secondary result (cursor, timestamp, …) aux:         u64              @48   tertiary (handle, length, …) timestamp: Instant            @56   Clock.Monotonic at completion

```
  enum CompletionKind: UInt32
    User = 0, Signal = 1, Timer = 2, Io = 3, Namespace = 4, Launch = 5, Grant =
  6,
    Net = 7, Stream = 8, Power = 9, Service = 10, Device = 11
```

`Device` completions come from DeviceKit ([17](17-devicekit.md) §6), not from a LibTessera call.

Every asynchronous call documents what it places in result0/result1/aux. A returned handle is always in result0 and is already in the caller's handle table when the packet is observed; if the packet's error is not Ok, result0 is 0 and nothing was added.

### 5.3 Backend note

Linux: one io_uring instance per Port (IORING_SETUP_SINGLE_ISSUER off, since any thread may submit; IORING_SETUP_DEFER_TASKRUN off), with waitAsync as POLL_ADD, timers as TIMEOUT, cancellation as ASYNC_CANCEL by user-data, and service-mediated operations completed through an internal eventfd-backed side queue merged in Port.wait. XNU: one kqueue per Port; asynchronous file/ network I/O is done by an internal worker pool with results posted through EVFILT_USER. Native kernel: a real completion queue object.

## 6. Memory

### 6.1 Model

A Memory object is a resizable, pageable, reference-counted container of bytes — the only kind of memory a process can map. Anonymous memory, shared memory, file data (through a File handle) and device stream buffers are all Memory or mappable like it. GPU buffers are not: they are DeviceKit objects (§17). The address space itself is not an object; mappings are created and destroyed by address.

Page size is a system constant reported by System.info(.Machine).pageSize — 16 KiB on ARM64, 4 KiB on the x64 compromise tier. All offsets and lengths in this section are page-aligned unless stated.

### 6.2 Types

```

### 6.3 Calls (all synchronous)

```
  Memory.create(size: Size, options: MemoryOptions) -> Result<Handle<Memory>,
  Error>
```

Zero-filled. Rights: default + Map. Errors: InvalidArgument (size 0 or unaligned), OutOfMemory, QuotaExceeded, NotEntitled (Contiguous).

```
  Memory.resize(memory: Handle<Memory>, size: Size) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Requires Manage, object created Resizable. Growing zero-fills; shrinking discards. Fails Busy if any mapping covers the range being removed.

```
  Memory.slice(parent: Handle<Memory>, offset: Size, length: Size, options:
  SliceOptions) -> Result<Handle<Memory>, Error>
  enum SliceOptions: UInt32     Shared = 0 (window onto parent), CopyOnWrite = 1
  (snapshot, lazily copied)
```

Requires Duplicate. A slice handle can be given away with narrower rights, which is how a process shares one region of a buffer.

```
  Memory.read(memory: Handle<Memory>, offset: Size, out: Buffer) -> Result<Void,
  Error>
  Memory.write(memory: Handle<Memory>, offset: Size, in: Buffer) -> Result<Void,
  Error>
```

Copy without mapping. Requires Read / Write. Byte-granular. Errors: OutOfRange.

```
  Memory.map(source: Handle<Memory|File>, offset: Size, length: Size, protection:
  Protection, options: MapOptions, hint: Address) -> Result<Address, Error>
```

Requires Map, plus Read for Protection.Read, Write for Protection.Write (unless Private), Execute for Protection.Execute. source may be a File (file- backed mapping; Write reaches the file unless Private). Errors: AccessDenied, NotEntitled (W|X), OutOfRange, OutOfMemory, AlreadyExists (Fixed).

```
  Memory.unmap(base: Address, length: Size) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Unmaps every page in range; partial unmap of a mapping splits it. Unmapping a reserved range releases it.

```
  Memory.protect(base: Address, length: Size, protection: Protection) ->
  Result<Void, Error>
```

Subject to the same right checks as map against each underlying object. W|X requires tessera.jit.

```
  Memory.commit(base: Address, length: Size) -> Result<Void, Error>
  Memory.decommit(base: Address, length: Size) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

commit guarantees physical backing now (fails OutOfMemory instead of faulting later). decommit releases backing; the pages read as zero afterwards. This is the allocator's madvise equivalent and the only one.

```
  Memory.reserve(length: Size, alignment: Size, hint: Address) -> Result<Address,
  Error>
```

Reserves an inaccessible address range that later map(.Fixed) calls can fill. Allocators (the Kira runtime allocator, Rust's) build arenas from this.

```
  Memory.query(address: Address) -> Result<MappingInfo, Error>
```

Describes the mapping or reserved range containing address. NotFound if unmapped.

```
  Memory.lock(memory: Handle<Memory>) -> Result<Bool, Error>
  Memory.unlock(memory: Handle<Memory>) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

For Discardable objects: lock pins the contents and reports whether they survived (false = the system discarded them; the object reads as zero). Caches use this.

```
  Memory.setCachePolicy(memory: Handle<Memory>, policy: CachePolicy) ->
  Result<Void, Error>
```

Requires Manage and tessera.driver. Only before the first mapping.

### 6.4 Backend

Linux: Memory = memfd_create (sealed for size where not Resizable; MFD_HUGETLB for HugePages), DeviceShareable = udmabuf, Contiguous = CMA via the Devices service. map = mmap with MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE for Fixed, MAP_PRIVATE for Private; guards are PROT_NONE pages; reserve = mmap(PROT_NONE, MAP_NORESERVE); commit = MADV_POPULATE_WRITE; decommit = MADV_DONTNEED on shared / MADV_FREE on private; Discardable = MADV_FREE semantics tracked by the library. XNU: mach_make_memory_entry_64 + mach_vm_map, vm_purgable_control for Discardable, IOSurface for DeviceShareable.

## 7. Threads and synchronisation

### 7.1 Model

A Thread is a kernel thread inside a Process. LibTessera owns thread creation end to end because there is no libc: it allocates the stack (a Memory object with guard pages), the thread-local storage block, sets the architectural TLS register, and runs the entry. Threads have a QoS class; realtime scheduling is an entitlement.

There is exactly one blocking synchronisation primitive: wait/wake on an address. Mutexes, condition variables, semaphores, once-cells, and parking are built on it by the runtime above (Rust std's futex -based sys::sync, Kira's runtime).

### 7.2 Types

```
  enum Qos: UInt32
    Background = 0, Utility = 1, Default = 2, UserInitiated = 3, UserInteractive
  = 4, Realtime = 5
```

```
  struct ThreadOptions (40 bytes)
    stackSize:    u64 @0     0 = default (from
  System.info(.Limits).defaultStackSize)
    guardSize:    u64 @8     0 = one page
    qos:          u32 @16
    flags:        u32 @20    bit0 DETACHED (no handle returned; termination still
  visible in Job/Process info)
    name:         Buffer @24 ≤ 64 bytes UTF-8, may be empty
```

```
  struct RealtimePolicy (24 bytes)
    period:        Duration @0    e.g. audio callback period
    computation: Duration @8      expected CPU per period
    constraint:    Duration @16   deadline within the period
```

```
  struct ThreadInfo (topic Thread, v1, 48 bytes)
    threadId: u64 @0, processId: u64 @8, state: u32 @16 (Created=0, Running=1,
  Blocked=2, Terminated=3),
    qos: u32 @20, exitCode: i64 @24, cpuTime: Duration @32, reserved: u64 @40
```

### 7.3 Calls (all synchronous)

```
  Thread.spawn(entry: Address, argument: UInt64, options: ThreadOptions) ->
  Result<Handle<Thread>, Error>
```

entry is a function fn(argument: u64) -> i64 in the platform calling convention. The thread runs immediately. Returns a handle with Wait | Inspect | Manage | SetProperty | Duplicate (not Transfer: threads never cross processes). Errors: OutOfMemory, QuotaExceeded (job thread limit), NotEntitled (Realtime qos).

```
  Thread.exit(code: Int64) -> noreturn
```

Terminates the calling thread; the last thread's exit terminates the process with that code. Stack and TLS are reclaimed by LibTessera.

```
  Thread.current() -> Handle<Thread>
```

A borrowed, never-closed handle to the calling thread (rights Inspect | SetProperty | Manage).

```
  Thread.id(thread: Handle<Thread>) -> Result<UInt64, Error>
```

Process-unique, never reused within the process's life.

```
  Thread.setQos(thread: Handle<Thread>, qos: Qos) -> Result<Void, Error>
  Thread.setRealtime(thread: Handle<Thread>, policy: RealtimePolicy) ->
  Result<Void, Error>
```

Requires Manage. setRealtime requires entitlement tessera.thread.realtime (granted with tessera.audio.*); the system may revoke it under thermal pressure (the thread drops to UserInteractive, reported via Thread.info).

```
  Thread.sleep(deadline: Deadline) -> Result<Void, Error>
  Thread.yield() -> Void
```

Thread.kill(thread: Handle<Thread>) -> Result<Void, Error>

Requires Manage. Terminates the thread at the next safe point without running any unwinding. Its stack is leaked until process exit. Exists for runtimes that need it (debuggers, watchdogs); ordinary code joins.

Join is Object.waitAsync(thread, TERMINATED, …); the exit code is Thread.info.exitCode.

```
  Thread.tlsBase() -> Address
  Thread.setTlsBase(base: Address) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Read/write the architectural thread pointer (TPIDR_EL0 on ARM64, FS on x64). Thread.spawn allocates and initialises a TLS block from the executable's TLS template (§11.5) before the entry runs, so #[thread_local] and Kira thread- locals work with no runtime setup; runtimes that manage their own TLS may replace it.

### 7.4 Wait/wake on address

```
  Sync.wait32(address: Address, expected: UInt32, deadline: Deadline) ->
  Result<Void, Error>
  Sync.wait64(address: Address, expected: UInt64, deadline: Deadline) ->
  Result<Void, Error>
```

Atomically checks *address == expected and, if so, blocks until woken or the deadline passes. Returns Ok when woken (spurious wakeups are permitted, callers loop), BadState if the value differed, Timeout on deadline. The address must be naturally aligned and mapped Read.

```
  Sync.wake(address: Address, count: UInt32) -> Result<UInt32, Error>
```

Wakes up to count waiters (UInt32.max = all). Works across processes when the address is in shared Memory mapped by both.

```
  Sync.requeue(address: Address, wakeCount: UInt32, target: Address,
  requeueCount: UInt32) -> Result<UInt32, Error>
```

Wakes wakeCount waiters and moves up to requeueCount others to wait on target (condition-variable broadcast without the thundering herd).

### 7.5 Backend

Linux: clone3(CLONE_VM|CLONE_FS|CLONE_FILES|CLONE_SIGHAND|CLONE_THREAD| CLONE_SYSVSEM|CLONE_SETTLS|CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID) with the stack from a Memory mapping; QoS = sched_setattr (SCHED_OTHER nice / SCHED_DEADLINE for Realtime); wait/wake = futex2 / futex (FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET with absolute CLOCK_MONOTONIC deadline, FUTEX_REQUEUE); kill = tgkill with an internal reserved signal handled only inside LibTessera's stub (the only signal Tessera ever installs). XNU: bsdthread_create / thread_create + thread_set_state, __ulock_wait2 / __ulock_wake, thread_policy_set for QoS and THREAD_TIME_CONSTRAINT_POLICY for realtime.

## 8. Time

### 8.1 Clocks

```
  enum Clock: UInt32
      Monotonic   = 0   never jumps, stops during suspend; all Deadlines are on this
  clock
      Boottime    = 1   like Monotonic but advances during suspend
      Realtime    = 2   nanoseconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z (UTC); read-only for
  apps; may jump
      ProcessCpu = 3    CPU consumed by the calling process
      ThreadCpu   = 4   CPU consumed by the calling thread
```

Time zones, locale, calendar and formatting are not LibTessera concerns: apps read UTC here and get the zone from the Settings service; apps can never set any clock (Settings redirect, §14.6).

```
  Time.read(clock: Clock) -> Result<Instant, Error>
  Time.resolution(clock: Clock) -> Result<Duration, Error>
```

Time.read is a vDSO-class fast path (no trap on Linux/XNU).

```
  Time.realtimeDetails() -> Result<RealtimeDetails, Error>
  struct RealtimeDetails (32 bytes)
      monotonicOffset: i64 @0    Realtime - Monotonic at the moment of the call
      synchronised: u8 @8        1 if the clock was set from a trusted source
      reserved: [u8; 7] @9
      lastSet: Instant @16       Monotonic instant of the last adjustment
      errorBound: Duration @24   estimated error, 0 if unknown
```

### 8.2 Timers

```
  Timer.create(clock: Clock) -> Result<Handle<Timer>, Error>
```

clock must be Monotonic or Boottime. A Boottime timer with the Wake option can wake the device from suspend (entitlement tessera.power.wake).

```
  Timer.set(timer: Handle<Timer>, deadline: Instant, slack: Duration, options:
  TimerOptions, port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<Void, Error>
  enum TimerOptions: UInt32 (flags)     None = 0, Wake = 1 << 0
```

One-shot. Arms (or re-arms, replacing any pending arming) the timer. Completion kind Timer, result0 = 1, result1 = actual fire instant. slack lets the system coalesce timers; 0 means precise. Cancelling delivers Cancelled.

```
  Timer.setPeriodic(timer: Handle<Timer>, first: Instant, period: Duration,
  slack: Duration, options: TimerOptions, port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) ->
  Result<Void, Error>
```


Multi-shot: one completion per period, result0 = number of expirations since the previous packet (>1 if the waiter fell behind), flags.MORE set.

```
  Timer.cancel(timer: Handle<Timer>) -> Result<Bool, Error>
```

Backend: Linux TIMEOUT / TIMEOUT_REMOVE SQEs for precise, timerfd (TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME, CLOCK_BOOTTIME_ALARM for Wake) for periodic/wake; XNU EVFILT_TIMER with NOTE_ABSOLUTE|NOTE_MACHTIME.

## 9. Events

```
  Event.create(initial: Signals) -> Result<Handle<Event>, Error>
```

A standalone signal word. Object.signal sets/clears SIGNALED and user bits; Object.waitAsync observes them. Used for in-process wakeups that must land on a Port (integrating a futex-based runtime with completion loops) and as a transferable "done" flag.

```
  EventPair.create() -> Result<(Handle<EventPair>, Handle<EventPair>), Error>
```

Two linked ends. Signals set on one end are observable on the other; when the last handle to one end closes, the other end asserts PEER_CLOSED. Send one end to another process for a cheap liveness/lease token (a grant lease, a surface lease, a lock).

Backend: Linux — in-process Event is a futex word plus an eventfd registered with each waiting Port; EventPair is an AF_UNIX socketpair carrying a 4-byte signal word, with POLLHUP as PEER_CLOSED. XNU — Mach port pairs with EVFILT_MACHPORT.

## 10. Channels

### 10.1 Model

A Channel is one end of a bidirectional, ordered, reliable, message-oriented transport that can carry handles. It is the IPC primitive: every system service, every child-process relay, every compositor conversation is a channel. Messages are delivered whole (no partial reads) and in order per direction. Loss is impossible; when a peer dies the survivor sees PEER_CLOSED after draining what was already queued.

Limits (from System.info(.Limits)): message ≤ 64 KiB bytes and ≤ 64 handles; per-direction queue ≤ 4 MiB or 1 024 messages, after which write returns ShouldWait and WRITABLE deasserts — backpressure, never unbounded buffering. Larger payloads travel as a Memory handle inside the message.

Handle transfer semantics: handles listed in write are moved — removed from the sender's table whether the write succeeds or fails (on failure they are closed), so a caller can never hold a handle whose ownership is ambiguous. A handle without the Transfer right makes the whole write fail with AccessDenied before anything moves.

### 10.2 Calls (all synchronous, non-blocking; readiness via Object.waitAsync)

Object.waitAsync)

```
  Channel.create() -> Result<(Handle<Channel>, Handle<Channel>), Error>
```

```
  Channel.write(channel: Handle<Channel>, bytes: Buffer, handles: [Handle<Any>],
  handleCount: UInt32) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Requires Write. Errors: ShouldWait (queue full), PeerClosed, OutOfRange (limits), AccessDenied (a handle lacks Transfer), InvalidHandle.

Channel.read(channel: Handle<Channel>, bytes: Buffer, handles: [Handle<Any>], handleCapacity: UInt32) -> Result<(Size, UInt32), Error>

Requires Read. Dequeues one whole message. ShouldWait if empty; PeerClosed if empty and the peer is gone; BufferTooSmall (message left queued; detail = bytes needed, and Channel.peek gives both sizes). Received handles are added to the caller's table with the rights they were sent with.

```
  Channel.peek(channel: Handle<Channel>) -> Result<(Size, UInt32), Error>
```

Sizes of the next message without dequeuing. ShouldWait if none.

```
  Channel.call(channel: Handle<Channel>, request: Buffer, requestHandles:
  [Handle<Any>], requestHandleCount: UInt32, response: Buffer, responseHandles:
  [Handle<Any>], responseHandleCapacity: UInt32, deadline: Deadline, port:
  Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Request/response in one operation. LibTessera writes a fresh transaction id into the first 8 bytes of request (the wire header's txid, §10.3), sends it, and matches the reply whose txid equals it — replies for other transactions are left for Channel.read. Asynchronous: completion kind Service, result0 = response bytes, result1 = response handles, error = Timeout, PeerClosed, BufferTooSmall, or the service's own error copied from an error reply. Many calls may be outstanding on one channel from many threads.

### 10.3 Tessera IPC wire format v1

Every message on a service channel begins with a 24-byte header; the body follows, encoded by the rules below. Protocols are declared in Kira as protocol constructs and the encoder/decoder is generated; the wire format is the stable contract, the Kira declaration is the source of truth.

struct MessageHeader (24 bytes) txid:    u64 @0    transaction id (0 for unsolicited events); set by Channel.call or the client ordinal: u64 @8    FNV-1a 64 of "ServiceName/MethodName"; a new signature is a new name flags:   u32 @16   bit0 RESPONSE, bit1 ERROR (body is an Error), bit2 EVENT (server→client, no reply) version: u32 @20   protocol CalVer as YYYYMM (e.g. 202610); receivers accept any version whose methods they know

Encoding: little-endian; fields in declaration order; each field aligned to its natural alignment within 8-byte-aligned blocks; Bool is u8; enums u32; String / Bytes / Vector<T> = u64 count followed by inline elements padded to 8; Optional<T> = u64 present (0/1) followed by T if present; nested structs inline; Handle<T> = u32 index into the message's handle array (0xFFFF_FFFF = none), and handles appear in the array in field order; Number is forbidden. An error reply's body is exactly one Error (16 bytes).

Example declaration (illustrative Kira):

```
  @Protocol("tessera.resolver", introduced: "2026.10")
  protocol Resolver {
        func resolve(name: String, family: AddressFamily) ->
  Result<Vector<NetAddress>, Error>
        event addressesChanged(interface: String)
  }
```

### 10.4 Backend

Linux: socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_SEQPACKET | SOCK_CLOEXEC), handles via SCM_RIGHTS (each transferred handle is re-materialised from its fd plus a 24-byte descriptor record LibTessera prepends to the datagram: object type, rights, object id — the receiver's LibTessera reconstructs the typed handle; rights on the descriptor are trusted only from the system side, i.e. peer credentials checked via SO_PEERCRED), SO_SNDBUF / SO_RCVBUF sized to the queue limit, POLLHUP as PEER_CLOSED. XNU: Mach ports with MACH_MSG_TYPE_MOVE_SEND for handle transfer and port-death notifications for PEER_CLOSED. Native kernel: channels are first- class objects.

## 11. Processes and jobs

### 11.1 Model

- A Job is a node in a tree. It owns processes and child jobs, carries a policy (limits), and dies as a unit: killing a job kills every process and job beneath it. The launcher creates one job per app session; the app may create child jobs for helpers.
- A Process is an address space, a handle table and a set of threads. It belongs to exactly one job. It has an identity assigned by the Launcher service: appId (bundle), processId, and whether it is the app's main process — the only one that receives a Presence handle.
- There is no fork. A process is created by Process.launch from an executable Node inside the app bundle (or a system tool the caller is entitled to), with an explicit list of handles it will receive and nothing else.
- Process.launch is brokered by the Launcher service so that identity, entitlement-derived sandbox and the child's System channel are minted by the system, never by the parent. The parent gets a private channel to the child and a Process handle.

### 11.2 Types

### 11.3 Calls

```
  Process.launch(executable: Handle<Node>, options: LaunchOptions, port:
  Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Asynchronous (Launcher service). Requires Read | Execute on executable, entitlement tessera.process.launch (default for apps that declare helpers; terminals/IDEs/build tools declare it), and the caller's job must not have DENY_LAUNCH. Completion kind Launch: result0 = Handle<Process> (rights Wait | Inspect | Manage | Duplicate), result1 = Handle<Channel> (parent end of the private channel), aux = child processId. Errors: NotEntitled, AccessDenied, QuotaExceeded, InvalidArgument (a StartupEntry uses a reserved tag the parent may not supply), NotFound (executable not in this bundle and not an entitled system tool), OutOfMemory.

The Launcher: verifies the executable is inside the caller's bundle (or an entitled system tool), derives the child's entitlement set (the parent's set ∩ the executable's declared set — a child can never exceed its parent), builds the child's sandbox from that set, mints the child's System channel with identity {appId, processId, isMain: false}, creates the process in the requested job, assembles the Startup message from the Launcher-owned entries plus the parent's, writes it to the child's bootstrap channel, and starts the main thread.

```
  Process.exit(code: Int64) -> noreturn
```

Terminates all threads immediately (no unwinding), closes all handles, frees the address space.

```
  Process.current() -> Handle<Process>
```

Borrowed handle to the calling process (Inspect | SetProperty).

```
  Process.watchTermination(port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Posts one completion under key on port when the process is asked to stop (03, Shutdown), so a service that waits on a port leaves through main and its runtime finishes. On Linux the backend blocks SIGTERM for the whole process and polls a signalfd beside the port's other operations; the completion's kind is Device, as for every backend source (17 §6.3). Call it before making any thread, since a thread takes its signal mask from the thread that made it. A process that waits anywhere but on a port must not call it: with SIGTERM blocked and never read, it could only be killed on the shutdown deadline. Process.launch clears the signal mask in the child, so the block is never inherited. The exported name is `processWatchTermination`.

```
  Process.kill(process: Handle<Process>) -> Result<Void, Error>
  Process.suspend(process: Handle<Process>) -> Result<Void, Error>
  Process.resume(process: Handle<Process>) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Require Manage. Kill is immediate and unconditional; the process's TERMINATED signal asserts and ProcessInfo.terminationReason = Killed. Suspend stops every thread at a safe point (used by the system for background freezing and by debuggers in the debug image).

```
  Job.create(parent: Handle<Job>, policy: JobPolicy) -> Result<Handle<Job>,
  Error>
  Job.kill(job: Handle<Job>) -> Result<Void, Error>
  Job.setPolicy(job: Handle<Job>, policy: JobPolicy) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

create requires Manage on parent; a child job's policy may only tighten its parent's. setPolicy may only tighten (loosening returns AccessDenied). Job handles carry Transfer so a parent can hand a helper a job handle limited to Inspect.

Waiting for a process or job is Object.waitAsync(handle, TERMINATED, …); the exit code and reason are in ProcessInfo.

### 11.4 The bootstrap protocol

A new process begins with exactly one handle: its bootstrap channel, delivered by the backend in a kernel-specific way (§21) and registered by LibTessera's entry stub as the first entry in the handle table. The first (and only) message on it is the Startup message:

```
  struct StartupMessage (variable)
      magic:       u32 @0    0x54535254 ("TSRT")
      version:     u32 @4    1
      entryCount: u32 @8
      flags:       u32 @12   bit0 IS_MAIN_PROCESS, bit1 DEBUG_IMAGE, bit2
  CERTIFIED_DEVICE
      appId:       u64 @16
      processId:   u64 @24
      jobId:       u64 @32
      reserved:    u64 @40
```

entries:     [StartupEntryWire; entryCount] @48      {tag: u32, handleIndex: u32} — handleIndex into the message's handle array

LaunchInfo (in the Launch Memory) is encoded with the §10.3 rules:

```
  struct LaunchInfo
    reason:      u32                Cold=0, Resume=1, Url=2, Intent=3, Helper=4,
  Debug=5
    arguments:   Vector<String>     argv-style, empty for GUI launches
    url:         Optional<String>   for Url launches
    intent:      Optional<Bytes>    opaque intent payload
    locale:      String             BCP-47 tag chosen by Settings (read-only for
  the app)
    workingDirectoryHint: Optional<String>        for command-line tools: the
  *display* path the user was in; not authority
```

`launchInfoCreate(reason, arguments)` makes the Memory a launch takes, with
a reason from `LaunchReason` (`LaunchReason.helper`), and
`processArguments()` reads back the arguments this process was started
with, its own name first, as `ProcessInfo.arguments` does on a Mac. No
program lays the block out itself.

### 11.5 Runtime initialisation

The process entry is the Kira runtime's. LibTessera has no entry stub and no
assembly. The first call that needs the handle table reads the Startup message
from the bootstrap channel (descriptor 0), builds the table from its handles and
points descriptors 0, 1 and 2 at the StdIn, StdOut and StdErr entries.

A process with no Startup message was started by the system before any
LibTessera process existed. It is a system process: it holds every entitlement
and is given a Node for the root (`SystemRoot`, tag 15) and a Job for its own
cgroup.

Executables are static images: the installer links an app's Kira IR against the
current system libraries, so there is no dynamic loader.

### 11.6 Entitlements

The Entitlements Memory page is a read-only, §10.3-encoded EntitlementSet: Vector<Entitlement { name: String, value: Optional<Bytes> }>, sorted by name, minted by the Launcher from the bundle's notarised declaration ∩ the parent's set. Consumers check it locally (Entitlement.has(name) is a Rust-std/Kira-runtime helper over the page, not a syscall); the backend sandbox (§21) enforces it. tessera.system.EntitlementChanged announces revocation at runtime; the page is replaced atomically and the old mapping keeps reading until unmapped.

Well-known entitlements referenced in this document: tessera.process.launch, tessera.jit, tessera.thread.realtime, tessera.network.client, tessera.network.server, tessera.network.local, tessera.network.raw, tessera.sensors.motion, tessera.sensors.environment, tessera.audio.capture, tessera.audio.playback (default), tessera.camera, tessera.haptics (default), tessera.driver (system only), tessera.power.wakelock, tessera.power.wake, tessera.container.shared.<id>, tessera.debug.crash (debug image), tessera.trace (default).

### 11.7 Backend

Linux: process = clone3(CLONE_VFORK|CLONE_VM…) in the Launcher followed by execveat of the AOT image, or CLONE_INTO_CGROUP into the job's cgroup; pidfd for the Process handle (TERMINATED = pidfd readable); Job = cgroup v2 subtree (limits map to memory.max, pids.max, cpu.weight) plus a kill via cgroup.kill; bootstrap channel = fd 0 (the only inherited fd, O_CLOEXEC on everything else); sandbox = user namespace + mount namespace containing only the container directories, seccomp filter generated from the entitlement set, Landlock as belt- and-braces on the container roots. XNU: posix_spawn from the Launcher with a special port for bootstrap, proc_info for info, process death via EVFILT_PROC, Jobs via coalition s and memorystatus, sandbox via sandbox_init profiles generated from the entitlement set.

1. The System channel protocol (tessera.system) Every process holds a System channel (tag 1). It is the process's line to the OS and the root of service discovery. Protocol methods (client → system, via Channel.call) and events (system → client, flags.EVENT):

@Protocol("tessera.system", introduced: "2026.10") protocol System { // discovery func connectService(name: String) -> Result<Handle<Channel>, Error> // NotEntitled if the service requires an entitlement the process lacks; NotFound if unknown func listServices() -> Result<Vector<ServiceInfo { name: String, requiredEntitlement: Optional<String> }>, Error>

```
     // lifecycle (events carry a sequence number; the app acks the ones marked
 needsAck)
     event lifecycle(seq: UInt64, state: LifecycleState, deadline:
 Optional<Instant>, needsAck: Bool)
         // LifecycleState: Foreground, Background, Suspending, Resumed,

     event memoryPressure(level: MemoryPressureLevel)             // Normal,
 Warning, Critical
     event terminateSoon(deadline: Instant, reason: UInt32)        // the app has

```

```
     // grants (see §14)
     event grantDelivered(requestId: UInt64, node: Handle<Node>, grantId:
 GrantId)      // for grants brokered for this process by its main process
     event grantRevoked(grantId: GrantId, reason: UInt32)
     event grantExpired(grantId: GrantId)
```

```
     // policy changes
     event entitlementChanged(entitlements: Handle<Memory>)        // replacement

     event powerChanged(info: PowerInfo)
     event thermalChanged(level: ThermalLevel)
     event networkChanged(summary: NetworkSummary)
     event deviceChanged(class: DeviceClass, deviceId: UInt64, added: Bool)
     event volumeChanged(mounted: Bool, path: String)              // NSWorkspace
 didMount/didUnmount
     event localeChanged(locale: String)
     event timeChanged(details: RealtimeDetails)                   // Realtime

Service channels are ordinary channels: PEER_CLOSED means the service restarted and the client reconnects via connectService. Services are resolved by name at connect time, which is what makes the set "changeable enough": a service can be replaced, split, or re-implemented without touching LibTessera, and its protocol evolves by adding methods (new ordinals) under CalVer.

## 13. Namespace and files

### 13.1 Model

The user owns the filesystem. A process holds exact capabilities:

- A Node is a namespace capability naming one file or directory, with rights Read | Enumerate | Create | Write | Delete | Traverse (the five permission- model operations plus Traverse). A Node on a directory covers that directory and, with Traverse, its subtree, scoped exactly as the grant that produced it.
- A File is a data handle to a file's bytes, obtained from a Node with File.open; it carries Read / Write / Map and nothing about names. Data I/O never touches the Namespace service.
- A Watch is a change-notification stream on a Node.
- Every namespace operation — lookup, list, create, delete, rename, attributes — goes through the Namespace service over tessera.namespace; LibTessera wraps this so callers see ordinary asynchronous calls. Every data operation — read, write, sync, resize, map — goes straight to the kernel on a File handle.
- Processes never see absolute paths. All paths are relative to a Node. Display paths for UI come from Node.info(.Display) and carry no authority.
- App-private containers (ContainerData/Cache/Temp) arrive at startup with full rights. ContainerCache is the app's directory under /Cache and may be emptied by the system at any time; an app that builds things also gets its directory under /BuildCache, which only the user empties ([05](05-storage-and-state.md)). Everything else requires a grant (§14): temporary, session, persistent, revocable, expirable, audited.
- Shared containers between apps are explicit (tessera.container.shared.<id> entitlement, SharedContainer.open). Two apps never see each other's data because of a common kernel user.
- The system side is immutable and simply absent from any app's namespace. Protected roots (a user's home root, container roots) refuse Delete with ProtectedNode; removing an account is a privileged system action outside this API.

### 13.2 Path rules

A Path is a Buffer of UTF-8, NFC-normalised, with these rules (violations return InvalidPath, detail = byte offset):

- components separated by /; no leading, trailing or doubled /; empty path means "this node";

- no component may be. or..; escaping a node's scope is impossible by construction;
- component ≤ 255 bytes, path ≤ 4 096 bytes; no NUL, no control characters U+0000–U+001F;
- case-sensitive, case-preserving; the Namespace service may additionally reject names that collide case-insensitively inside user-visible locations (policy, reported as AlreadyExists);
- symbolic links are not exposed: a symlink in a granted subtree is reported as NodeKind.Link and cannot be traversed (NotDirectory). Hard links are not creatable.

### 13.3 Types

```
 enum NodeKind: UInt32       File = 0, Directory = 1, Link = 2, Selection = 3
 (virtual directory of picker results), Special = 4

```
 enum CreateKind: UInt32       File = 0, Directory = 1
 enum CreateOptions: UInt32 (flags)       None = 0, Exclusive = 1 << 0 (fail if
 exists), OpenExisting = 1 << 1 (return existing file's Node if present;
 requires Read on it)
 enum DeleteOptions: UInt32 (flags)       None = 0, Recursive = 1 << 0, Permanent =
 1 << 1 (bypass the volume's trash policy if the user allows it; otherwise
 ignored)

 replace an existing destination; requires Delete on it), Exchange = 1 << 1

 @16 padded
```

13.4 Namespace calls (asynchronous, kind Namespace)

```
 Node.lookup(base: Handle<Node>, path: Path, rights: Rights, port: Handle<Port>,
 key: Key) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Resolves path beneath base and returns a Node with rights (must be ⊆ base's rights; RIGHTS_SAME = inherit). Requires Traverse on base to descend into directories; the final component needs no right to be named, but the returned

Node's rights are capped by the base. result0 = Handle<Node>. Errors: NotFound, InvalidPath, NotDirectory, AccessDenied, GrantExpired/Revoked.

```
  Node.list(directory: Handle<Node>, cursor: UInt64, out: Buffer, port:
  Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Requires Enumerate. Fills out with packed DirEntry records. result0 = bytes written, result1 = next cursor (0 = end). Listing is a snapshot per call, not per cursor sequence; concurrent changes may cause omissions or repeats, as on every OS. Names only — a Node for an entry is obtained with lookup, which is where rights are decided.

```
  Node.create(directory: Handle<Node>, name: Path, kind: CreateKind, options:
  CreateOptions, rights: Rights, port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<Void,
  Error>
```

Requires Create. name is a single component. Returns a Node to the new item with rights ⊆ directory's rights (Create alone lets you make the file; writing into it additionally needs Write on the directory — this is the "Create does not imply Update" rule made mechanical). result0 = Handle<Node>. Errors: AlreadyExists, NoSpace, QuotaExceeded, AccessDenied.

```
  Node.delete(directory: Handle<Node>, name: Path, options: DeleteOptions, port:
  Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Requires Delete on directory; Recursive additionally requires Delete | Traverse covering the subtree. Deleting a protected root (or naming one via a grant) fails ProtectedNode. Open File handles on a deleted file keep working until closed (the data lives until the last reference).

```
  Node.rename(fromDirectory: Handle<Node>, fromName: Path, toDirectory:
  Handle<Node>, toName: Path, options: RenameOptions, port: Handle<Port>, key:
  Key) -> Result<Void, Error>
```


Requires Delete on fromDirectory and Create on toDirectory (both may be the same Node). Atomic within a volume; across volumes fails Unsupported (copy- then-delete is the caller's decision, never silent).

```
  Node.info(node: Handle<Node>, out: Buffer, port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) ->
  Result<Void, Error>
```

Requires Inspect. Fetches a fresh NodeInfo into out; result0 = bytes written. The synchronous Object.info(node,.Node) returns the last snapshot LibTessera cached without a round trip; use Node.info when freshness matters.

```
  Node.setAttributes(node: Handle<Node>, attributes: NodeAttributes, port:
  Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Requires SetProperty and Write.

```
  Node.displayPath(node: Handle<Node>, out: Buffer, port: Handle<Port>, key: Key)
  -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Requires Inspect. A user-facing, localised path string ("Documents/Reports/ Q3.pdf") for UI only; never accepted as input anywhere.

```
  Node.watch(node: Handle<Node>, mask: WatchMask) -> Result<Handle<Watch>, Error>
  Watch.read(watch: Handle<Watch>, out: Buffer) -> Result<Size, Error>
```

watch requires Enumerate (directories) or Read (files) and is synchronous (the subscription is set up on the service channel lazily). Watch.read is non-blocking and returns packed WatchEvent s; wait for READABLE. If events were dropped the

Watch asserts OVERRUN and Watch.read returns Overrun once; the consumer rescans.

```
  SharedContainer.open(id: Buffer, rights: Rights, port: Handle<Port>, key: Key)
  -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Requires entitlement tessera.container.shared.<id>. result0 = Handle<Node> for the container root.

### 13.5 File calls (data path)

```
  File.open(node: Handle<Node>, mode: OpenMode, port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) ->
  Result<Void, Error>
```

Asynchronous (the Namespace service performs the open and hands back the data handle). Read mode requires Read; Write/Append/Truncate require Write. result0 = Handle<File> with rights Read / Write matching the mode plus Map | Duplicate | Transfer | Wait | Inspect. Errors: IsDirectory, AccessDenied, Busy (exclusively locked), GrantExpired/Revoked.

All remaining File calls are kernel-direct.

```
  File.read(file: Handle<File>, offset: UInt64, buffers: [Buffer], bufferCount:
  UInt32, port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<Void, Error>
  File.write(file: Handle<File>, offset: UInt64, buffers: [Buffer], bufferCount:
  UInt32, port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Positional, scatter/gather, no file position state (Rust's Seek is a number in the std). offset = UInt64.max on write means "append atomically" (required with Append mode). Completion kind Io, result0 = bytes transferred (short transfers are legal; 0 on read = EOF). Errors: NoSpace, QuotaExceeded, OutOfRange (beyond Limits.maxFileSize), Internal.

File.readMemory(file: Handle<File>, offset: UInt64, memory: Handle<Memory>, memoryOffset: UInt64, length: Size, port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<Void, Error> File.writeMemory(file: Handle<File>, offset: UInt64, memory: Handle<Memory>, memoryOffset: UInt64, length: Size, port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<Void, Error>

I/O directly between a file and a Memory object without a user buffer (zero-copy where the backend can, e.g. registered buffers / splice). Requires Write / Read on memory respectively.

```
 File.sync(file: Handle<File>, options: SyncOptions, port: Handle<Port>, key:
 Key) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

```
 File.resize(file: Handle<File>, size: UInt64, port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) ->
 Result<Void, Error>
```

Requires Write. Growing produces zeros (sparse where supported). Busy if a Map of the removed range exists.

```
 File.allocate(file: Handle<File>, offset: UInt64, length: Size, options:
 AllocateOptions, port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<Void, Error>
 enum AllocateOptions: UInt32 (flags)      None = 0 (preallocate), PunchHole = 1 <<
 0, ZeroRange = 1 << 1
```

```
 File.clone(file: Handle<File>, source: Handle<File>, port: Handle<Port>, key:
 Key) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Makes the file's contents those of source, sharing source's blocks rather than
copying them (Linux: FICLONE). Requires Write on file and Read on source. Both
must be on one volume whose file system shares blocks; otherwise
Unsupported, and the caller copies.

```
 File.lock(file: Handle<File>, offset: UInt64, length: Size, mode: LockMode,
 port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<Void, Error>
 File.unlock(file: Handle<File>, offset: UInt64, length: Size) -> Result<Void,
 Error>
```

Advisory byte-range locks owned by the File handle (not the process); closing the handle releases them. length = 0 = to end of file. Completion when acquired; deadline is expressed by cancelling.

```
 File.info(file: Handle<File>) -> Result<FileInfo, Error>
 struct FileInfo (topic File, v1, 48 bytes)        size: u64 @0, allocated: u64 @8,
 modified: Instant @16, blockSize: u32 @24, mode: u32 @28 (OpenMode), nodeId:
 u64 @32, volumeId: u64 @40
```

Synchronous (kernel fstat).

Memory.map(file, …) maps file data; Write mappings are write-back; Private gives copy-on-write.

### 13.6 Implementation: the Namespace service

- Runs as a system process holding the real filesystem roots. Per client process it keeps a view: the set of Nodes that process holds, each recorded with its scope (the real path it stands for), rights, grant id and lifetime. Nodes are channel-backed: a Node handle in the client is a LibTessera-side record {serviceNodeId, rights, cachedInfo} bound to the client's tessera.namespace channel; namespace calls are Channel.call s carrying serviceNodeId, so a forged id is meaningless (the service only honours ids in that channel's view).
- lookup is resolved by the service beneath the scope with the backend's safe-resolution primitive (Linux openat2(RESOLVE_BENEATH | RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS | RESOLVE_NO_MAGICLINKS)), never by string concatenation, and never escapes the scope.
- File.open is performed by the service with the flags that match the granted rights; the resulting kernel object travels back through the channel as a handle (Linux: fd via SCM_RIGHTS, opened O_RDONLY / O_RDWR, so Read / Write are kernel-enforced on the data path). A File handle carries no name and cannot be turned back into a Node.
- Listing and attributes are performed by the service — clients never hold a directory fd, so Enumerate, Create, Delete, Traverse are enforced entirely inside the service, on a per-Node-per-client basis. This is the point of the split: the kernel cannot express "create but not delete" per handle; the

service can, and the kernel guarantees the client has no other way in (§21.4). • Watches are inotify / fanotify (Linux) or EVFILT_VNODE /FSEvents (XNU) subscriptions inside the service, forwarded over a per-Watch channel; the Watch handle is that channel with the Watch type. • Containers are real directories under a per-app root the service creates at install; Temp is purged at session end, Cache under storage pressure (announced via memoryPressure -style storagePressure events in a later CalVer). • Grant lifetime enforcement: on expiry or revocation the service drops the Node from the view; subsequent calls fail GrantExpired / GrantRevoked, and already-open File handles are not revoked (data already in hand stays; new access does not) — mirroring how a user thinks about "you can keep what I gave you, but no more". • Audit: every request, grant, denial, expiry and revocation is written to the Audit service with {appId, processId, requestedScope, rights, outcome, timestamp, interaction token id}; the audit reference returned in Error.detail indexes this log.

## 14. Grants, presence and pickers

### 14.1 Model

- Presence is an object that represents an app's right to interact with the user. Exactly one handle exists per app session, delivered to the main process at startup (tag 2). It carries Grant | Inspect, never Duplicate or Transfer: it cannot be copied or given to a child. Every call that can raise authority through the user takes a Presence handle, so only the main process can make one — a child process, helper, extension, daemon or CLI tool cannot, structurally.
- An InteractionToken is proof that a real, hardware-originated user event reached a front-facing surface of this app. MosaicDisplay mints tokens when it delivers hardware input to a KCoreSurface, attaches them to the input event, and remembers them. A token is bound to {appId, surfaceId, issue instant}, single-use, and expires — by default 30 s after issue, or immediately when the surface stops being front-facing. Software- synthesised events (including the agent Control API) carry no token.
- A grant request is causally connected to interaction because it must present a token. The Presence service verifies the token with MosaicDisplay (issued to this app, unspent, unexpired, surface still front-facing), then shows the trusted permission UI, then mints the Node and records everything in the Audit service.
- A main process brokers for a child by naming the child's Process handle in the request; the Node is delivered to the child on its System channel (grantDelivered), never to the requester, so "the main process is brokering a specific grant, not lending its authority" is literally how the bytes flow.

### 14.2 Types

```
 struct InteractionToken (32 bytes)
  id:         u128 @0       random, unguessable
  surfaceId: u64    @16     MosaicDisplay surface that received the event
  issued:     Instant @24   Boottime
```

```
 typedef GrantId = u128
```

```
 enum GrantLifetime: UInt32
  Once        = 0     valid for one namespace operation chain; auto-released when
```

the Node is closed Session     = 1    until the app session ends Persistent = 2     survives relaunch; recoverable with Grant.restore(grantId)

```
 enum PickerMode: UInt32
     OpenFile = 0, OpenFiles = 1, OpenDirectory = 2, OpenDirectories = 3, SaveFile
 = 4, SaveInto = 5 (choose a directory and a new name)
```

```
 struct PickerOptions (96 bytes)

 the user chooses to allow)

     title:            Buffer   @64            short prompt text shown by the trusted
 UI (sanitised)
     reserved:         [u64;2] @80
```

```
 struct GrantRecord (variable, §10.3 encoding)       from Grant.list / Grant.info
     grantId: GrantId, requestId: UInt64, scopeDisplay: String, kind: NodeKind,
 rights: Rights,
     lifetime: GrantLifetime, issued: Instant, expires: Optional<Instant>, state:
 GrantState,
     targetProcessId: UInt64, auditRef: UInt64
 enum GrantState: UInt32        Active = 0, Expired = 1, Revoked = 2, Released = 3,
 Denied = 4
```

14.3 Calls (asynchronous, kind Grant, via tessera.presence)

```
 Grant.request(presence: Handle<Presence>, target: Handle<Node>, rights: Rights,
 lifetime: GrantLifetime, forProcess: Handle<Process>?, token: InteractionToken,
 port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Asks the user to widen rights on a Node the app already holds (e.g. it has Read on a document and wants Write; it has a directory with Enumerate and wants Create). Requires Grant on presence. If forProcess is set, the caller must hold Manage on it and the process must be in the caller's job tree. Completion:

result0 = Handle<Node> (or 0 when forProcess was set — the Node went to the child), result1 = requestId, aux = audit reference. Errors: NotMainProcess, NoInteraction, NotFrontmost, UserDenied, InvalidArgument (rights not a superset of current), GrantExpired/Revoked.

```
  Picker.present(presence: Handle<Presence>, mode: PickerMode, options:
  PickerOptions, token: InteractionToken, port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) ->
  Result<Void, Error>
```

Shows the trusted Tessera picker. The user's selection is the grant: the completion's result0 is a Node for the chosen file/directory (single modes) or a NodeKind.Selection virtual directory whose entries are the chosen items (multi modes; lookup each by name to get its Node — each carries the granted rights), with no access to anything around them. Save modes return a Node with Create on the chosen directory restricted to the chosen name (Node.create with any other name fails AccessDenied) — or, with SaveFile, the created file's Node directly. result1 = requestId, aux = audit reference. With forProcess set the result is delivered to the child as grantDelivered and result0 = 0. Errors as above plus Cancelled if the user dismissed the picker.

```
  Grant.restore(presence: Handle<Presence>, grantId: GrantId, port: Handle<Port>,
  key: Key) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Re-obtains a Persistent grant's Node in a later session with no user interaction (no token needed — the user already decided). result0 = Handle<Node>. Errors: NotFound, GrantExpired, GrantRevoked (the user withdrew it in Settings; the app should forget the id).

```
  Grant.release(grantId: GrantId, port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<Void,
  Error>
```

Voluntarily ends a grant (any process holding a Node from it may call this). Nodes from the grant fail GrantRevoked afterwards.

Grant.list(presence: Handle<Presence>, out: Buffer, port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<Void, Error> Grant.info(grantId: GrantId, out: Buffer, port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<Void, Error>

list returns Vector<GrantRecord> for the app; info one record. result0 = bytes written; BufferTooSmall with the size in detail.

### 14.4 Other interactive authority

The same presence + token discipline covers every runtime prompt, so no domain invents its own:

```
  Authorization.request(presence: Handle<Presence>, capability: Buffer,
  parameters: Buffer, forProcess: Handle<Process>?, token: InteractionToken,
  port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

capability is a dotted name (tessera.agent.control, tessera.location.precise, tessera.contacts.read, tessera.camera, …); parameters is a §10.3-encoded struct defined by that capability. On approval the entitlement page is updated (entitlementChanged) and, for handle-bearing capabilities, result0 is the minted handle (e.g. a Channel to tessera.agent). result1 = requestId, aux = audit reference.

```
  Settings.redirect(presence: Handle<Presence>, setting: Buffer, token:
  InteractionToken, port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Apps can never change time, locale, or any system setting. This is the one sanctioned move: open Settings on setting (or, for settings that allow it, a per- setting OS prompt). Completion result0 = 1 if the user changed it, 0 otherwise.

### 14.5 The child-brokering flow, end to end

1. The user types a command in a visible terminal. MosaicDisplay delivers the key events to the terminal's surface, each carrying an InteractionToken. The terminal's runtime keeps the most recent token per surface.
1. The terminal launches the CLI tool with Process.launch, passing ContainerTemp, StdIn/Out/Err, and a ParentChannel. The tool gets its own System channel from the Launcher (isMain: false, no Presence).
1. The tool needs ~/Projects/foo. It has no Node for it. It sends a request on ParentChannel (a protocol the terminal defines; the spec only requires the transport).
1. The terminal (main process) calls Picker.present(presence,.OpenDirectory, options{ rights: Read|Enumerate|Traverse|Write|Create, lifetime:.Session, forProcess: toolProcess }, token).
1. The Presence service validates the token with MosaicDisplay, checks the terminal's surface is front-facing, shows the trusted picker.
1. The user picks the directory. The Namespace service adds the Node to the tool's view; the tool receives grantDelivered(requestId, node, grantId) on its System channel; the terminal's completion carries requestId and result0 = 0.
1. The tool proceeds. When it exits, Session grants issued for it are released; the Audit log has the whole chain.

An IDE running a compiler is the same flow with "compiler" for "tool". A hidden tab, background task or daemon has no front-facing surface, therefore no valid token, therefore no prompt.

### 14.6 Backend

The Presence service is a Tessera process; MosaicDisplay is the token authority. LibTessera's role is only transport (Channel.call on tessera.presence) and the handle types. Nothing here depends on the kernel.

## 15. Network

### 15.1 Model

An Endpoint is a network endpoint of a stated family and protocol. LibTessera offers exactly the kernel-level socket surface — bind, listen, accept, connect, send, receive, options — as completion-based operations on typed handles. Name resolution (tessera.resolver), interface/connectivity state (tessera.network), proxies and TLS are services or libraries above. Local IPC uses channels, never sockets.

Entitlements are enforced by the sandbox at process creation (§21): tessera.network.client (outbound), tessera.network.server (bind non- ephemeral, listen), tessera.network.local (loopback only), tessera.network.raw (raw/ICMP; system only). No entitlement → Endpoint.create fails NotEntitled and the kernel refuses the underlying object too.

### 15.2 Types

```

    BindToInterface = 18, ReceiveErrorQueue = 19, TcpFastOpen = 20, IpV6Only = 21
```

```
  Endpoint.accept(endpoint: Handle<Endpoint>, peer: NetAddress*, port:
  Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Completion kind Net: result0 = new Handle<Endpoint>; out_peer filled before the packet is posted. Errors: BadState, ConnectionReset (the pending connection died), QuotaExceeded.

```
  Endpoint.connect(endpoint: Handle<Endpoint>, address: NetAddress, port:

```

For UDP, sets the default peer. Errors: ConnectionRefused, Unreachable, Timeout (cancel to impose a deadline), AddressNotAvailable.

  Endpoint.receive(endpoint: Handle<Endpoint>, buffers: [Buffer], bufferCount:
  UInt32, flags: ReceiveFlags, port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<Void,
  Error>
```

result0 = bytes; result1 = ReceiveTimestamps timestamp if enabled; aux = flags (bit0 TRUNCATED for datagrams). 0 bytes received on a stream = orderly close. Errors: ConnectionReset, PeerClosed, Unreachable.

```
  Endpoint.sendTo(endpoint, buffers, bufferCount, address: NetAddress, flags,

Synchronous. Option values are u32 unless the option is an address (MulticastJoin/Leave: NetAddress + interface) or a string (BindToInterface). Unsupported for options the backend lacks.

Readiness-style consumers use Object.waitAsync(endpoint, READABLE|WRITABLE|…); Object.info(endpoint,.Endpoint) gives addresses and state.

### 15.4 Backend

Linux: socket / bind / listen direct (allowed by the entitlement-derived seccomp filter), ACCEPT / CONNECT / SENDMSG / RECVMSG / SHUTDOWN as io_uring SQEs, setsockopt / getsockopt direct; sendMany / receiveMany = sendmmsg / recvmmsg. XNU: BSD sockets with a worker pool completing via the Port's kqueue. A native kernel: endpoints are objects.

## 16. Device streams

### 16.1 Model

Every continuous hardware data path — sensors, audio in/out, camera frames, haptic patterns — is a Stream: a ring of DeviceShareable Memory buffers shared between the process and the Devices service (which owns the hardware), with buffer ownership passed back and forth as completions. Output streams: the app enqueues a filled buffer, the completion says it was consumed. Input streams: the app enqueues an empty buffer, the completion says it was filled and carries

timestamps. This one model serves 3-axis accelerometer samples at 200 Hz, 48 kHz audio, and 4K camera frames; only the descriptor differs.

Privacy: the Devices service turns on the system indicator for microphone/ camera, refuses capture from backgrounded processes unless entitled (tessera.audio.capture.background), and every open is audited.

### 16.3 Calls

```
  Device.list(class: DeviceClass, out: Buffer, port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) ->
  Result<Void, Error>
```

Vector<DeviceInfo>; result0 = bytes. Requires the class entitlement (tessera.sensors.motion covers Accelerometer/Gyroscope/Gravity/ LinearAcceleration/RotationVector/StepCounter/StepDetector/Significant; tessera.sensors.environment the rest; tessera.audio.capture; tessera.audio.playback; tessera.camera; tessera.haptics). Hot-plug arrives as deviceChanged on the System channel.

```
  Stream.open(descriptor: StreamDescriptor, port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) ->
  Result<Void, Error>
```

Completion kind Stream: result0 = Handle<Stream>, result1 = negotiated buffer size, aux = negotiated buffer count. The service may adjust the format within what it advertised; read back with Object.info(.Stream). Errors: NotEntitled, NotFound, FormatUnsupported, DeviceBusy (EXCLUSIVE held by another), UserDenied (the class needs a one-time authorization the app never obtained — obtain it with Authorization.request).

```
  Stream.buffer(stream: Handle<Stream>, index: UInt32) -> Result<Handle<Memory>,
  Error>
```

Synchronous. Returns the Memory for ring slot index (mappable; Read for input streams, Read|Write for output). Call once per slot and map.

```
  Stream.enqueue(stream: Handle<Stream>, index: UInt32, packet: StreamPacket,
  port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Hands slot index to the device. Completion when the device is done with it: result0 = index, result1 = packet.timestamp (actual), aux = packet.length | (packet.flags << 32). For output streams packet describes the data the app wrote; for input streams the app passes an empty packet and reads the completion's. Underrun / Overrun are reported in the completion error with the slot still returned. Errors: BadState, OutOfRange, DeviceLost.

```
  Stream.start(stream: Handle<Stream>, port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) ->
  Result<Void, Error>
  Stream.stop(stream: Handle<Stream>, port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) ->
  Result<Void, Error>
  Stream.flush(stream: Handle<Stream>, port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) ->
  Result<Void, Error>
```

stop returns every enqueued slot with Cancelled. flush (output) completes when everything enqueued has actually played/been consumed.

```
  Stream.reconfigure(stream: Handle<Stream>, descriptor: StreamDescriptor, port:
  Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Only while stopped; buffers are reallocated and Stream.buffer must be called again.

```
  Stream.control(stream: Handle<Stream>, request: UInt32, in: Buffer, out:
  Buffer, port: Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<Void, Error>
```


Class-specific controls with stable ids published per class (camera: focus, exposure, zoom, torch; audio: volume/route hints; haptic: intensity). Unknown request → Unsupported. This is the only extension point and it is typed by class, not an ioctl free-for-all.

### 16.4 Audio specifics

Audio output apps request LOW_LATENCY with framesPerBuffer at the device's minimum (reported in DeviceInfo.capabilities), run a thread with Thread.setRealtime sized to the buffer period, and keep ≥ 2 slots enqueued. The Devices service mixes (system mixer) unless EXCLUSIVE is granted (tessera.audio.exclusive, media platforms). Routing (which speaker, Bluetooth) is system policy exposed via tessera.devices events, never a per-app choice beyond Stream.control hints.

### 16.5 Backend

Linux: the Devices service owns ALSA (snd_pcm via direct ioctls, no alsa-lib), V4L2 (VIDIOC_* with DMABUF memory), IIO (iio_buffer character devices) and the haptic input FF interface; ring buffers are dma-buf/udmabuf Memory, completions travel over a per-stream channel that LibTessera folds into the Port. XNU: CoreAudio HAL / AVFoundation / CoreMotion equivalents behind the same service. A stream's kernel-facing implementation is entirely inside the service; apps never see a device node.

## 17. GPU devices, buffers and fences

LibTessera has none. They belong to DeviceKit ([17](17-devicekit.md)), the
driver interface, the way Apple keeps them out of libSystem and in IOKit.

- DeviceKit sits below LibTessera's services and below Ember. The Devices, Power and Volume services are DeviceKit clients. Applications never link it; Ember uses it for GPU work, as Metal uses IOKit.
- LibTessera, the library, never links DeviceKit. DeviceKit links LibTessera for one thing: its asynchronous calls take a LibTessera `Port`, and their completions arrive there with kind `Device` (§5.2). No other LibTessera object crosses into DeviceKit.
- DeviceKit objects are not handles. They are not in the handle table and are not sent through a `Channel`; a surface or fence crosses processes as a 16-byte token written into a channel message.
- A GPU buffer is a DeviceKit surface, as an IOSurface is on macOS. It is not a LibTessera `Memory`.
- A fence is a DeviceKit timeline, as `MTLSharedEvent` is on macOS. LibTessera has no fence type.
- DeviceKit finishes its completions through a private module, `LibTesseraBackend`, that only DeviceKit links ([17](17-devicekit.md) §6.3). It is not part of this surface.
- DeviceKit is per kernel, like IOKit. LibTessera's surface is kernel-neutral, and nothing GPU-specific reaches through it to the kernel.

 struct PowerInfo (64 bytes)        read from a system-maintained shared page; no
 trap
     batteryPercent:   u32 @0       0–100, 0xFFFF_FFFF = no battery
     batteryState:     u32 @4       Unknown=0, Discharging=1, Charging=2, Full=3,
 NotCharging=4
     externalPower:    u32 @8       None=0, Usb=1, Wireless=2, Dock=3, Mains=4
     thermalLevel:     u32 @12      Nominal=0, Fair=1, Serious=2, Critical=3

     gpuThrottlePercent:    u32 @48
     reserved1:        u32 @52
     updated:          Instant @56    Boottime
```

```
 enum WakeLockKind: UInt32        Cpu = 0 (keep running while backgrounded), Display
 = 1 (keep the screen on; GUI front-most only), Audio = 2 (implied by an active
 audio output stream), Network = 3 (keep radios up for a transfer)
```

### 18.2 Calls

```
 Power.read() -> Result<PowerInfo, Error>
```

Synchronous, reads the shared page. Changes are pushed as powerChanged / thermalChanged events on the System channel.

```
 WakeLock.acquire(kind: WakeLockKind, reason: Buffer, timeout: Duration, port:
 Handle<Port>, key: Key) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Entitlement tessera.power.wakelock (Display needs only front-most; Audio is automatic). result0 = Handle<WakeLock>; closing releases. timeout caps the lock (0 = system default, never unlimited for Cpu). The system may revoke under

thermal or battery policy: the handle asserts PEER_CLOSED and Object.info shows revoked. Every acquisition is audited and shown in Settings' battery view.

```
  Power.scheduleWake(deadline: Instant, tolerance: Duration, port: Handle<Port>,
  key: Key) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Entitlement tessera.power.wake. Asks to have the process resumed (or launched with LaunchInfo.reason = Resume) at deadline (Boottime) ± tolerance. The completion is the wake itself. Equivalent to a Timer.set(.Wake) that survives process death.

Backend: Linux wakeup_source via the Power service (/sys/power/wake_lock on Android-style kernels, or epoll on a wake-capable timerfd), CLOCK_BOOTTIME_ALARM; thermal via thermal_zone; battery via power_supply uevents — all inside the Power service, which publishes the shared page. XNU: IOPMAssertions, IOPSCopyPowerSourcesInfo.

## 19. Random

```
  Random.fill(out: Buffer) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Cryptographically secure bytes from the kernel CSPRNG; never blocks after early boot (LibTessera's init on a certified device asserts the pool is seeded). This is the whole surface: key derivation, hashing and ciphers are libraries above (Kira's crypto framework), not system calls.

Backend: Linux getrandom(0), XNU getentropy / SecRandomCopyBytes equivalent syscall.

## 20. Diagnostics and system information

### 20.1 Logging and tracing

```
 enum LogLevel: UInt32     Trace = 0, Debug = 1, Info = 2, Notice = 3, Warning =
 4, Error = 5, Fault = 6
```

```
 Log.write(level: LogLevel, subsystem: Buffer, category: Buffer, message:
 Buffer) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Structured, ring-buffered by the system logger; subsystem / category ≤ 64 bytes, message ≤ 4 KiB. Privacy: messages are private by default in the persisted log (redacted for other apps and for non-debug images); Fault entries trigger a crash-report-style capture.

```
 Trace.enabled(category: Buffer) -> Bool
 Trace.begin(category: Buffer, name: Buffer, args: Buffer) -> Void
 Trace.end(category: Buffer) -> Void
 Trace.instant(category: Buffer, name: Buffer, args: Buffer) -> Void
 Trace.counter(category: Buffer, name: Buffer, value: Int64) -> Void
 Trace.flow(category: Buffer, name: Buffer, flowId: UInt64, phase: UInt32) ->
 Void     (phase: Begin=0, Step=1, End=2)
```

Zero-cost when the category is disabled (a shared-page bitmap check). Trace events go to a per-process shared ring consumed by the system tracer; args is §10.3-encoded key/value pairs. Entitlement tessera.trace (default).

### 20.2 Crash and debug (debug image / entitled only)

```
 Crash.setReporter(channel: Handle<Channel>) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

Registers a channel that receives CrashReport { thread: u64, reason: u32, faultAddress: u64, registers: Bytes, backtrace: Vector<u64> } for any fatal fault in this process, produced by the system (not by the crashing process) before termination. Entitlement tessera.debug.crash. Production apps get crash reports through the Store/Settings pipeline instead.

```
 Debug.break() -> Void
 Debug.isAttached() -> Bool
```

break traps into an attached debugger, or is a no-op on production images.

```
 Debug.attach(pid: u64) -> Result<Vector<u64>, Error>          (the threads, the first the process's own)
 Debug.threads(pid: u64) -> Result<Vector<u64>, Error>
 Debug.continue(thread: u64, signal: u32) -> Result<Void, Error>
 Debug.step(thread: u64, signal: u32) -> Result<Void, Error>
 Debug.interrupt(thread: u64) -> Result<Void, Error>
 Debug.detach(thread: u64, signal: u32) -> Result<Void, Error>
 Debug.kill(thread: u64) -> Result<Void, Error>
 Debug.wait() -> Result<DebugEvent, Error>
 Debug.poll() -> Result<Optional<DebugEvent>, Error>
 Debug.registers(thread: u64) -> Result<Vector<u64>, Error>
 Debug.setRegisters(thread: u64, registers: Vector<u64>) -> Result<Void, Error>
 Debug.signal(thread: u64) -> Result<DebugSignal, Error>
 Debug.readMemory(pid: u64, address: u64, count: u64) -> Result<Bytes, Error>
 Debug.writeMemory(pid: u64, address: u64, bytes: Bytes) -> Result<Void, Error>
 Debug.regions(pid: u64) -> Result<Vector<CrashedRegion>, Error>        (its mappings, lowest first)
 Debug.auxiliaryVector(pid: u64) -> Result<Bytes, Error>
 Debug.architecture() -> Architecture                                  (the register layout's)
 Debug.portOpen() -> Result<DebugPort, Error>
 Debug.portRead(port: DebugPort, wait: u64) -> Result<Bytes, Error>     (wait in ns; empty when nothing came)
 Debug.portWrite(port: DebugPort, bytes: Bytes) -> Result<Void, Error>
```

```
 enum DebugStopCause: UInt8 (open)     Signal = 0, Clone = 3, Exit = 6, Interrupt = 128
 struct DebugStop                      signal: u32, cause: DebugStopCause
 enum DebugChange                      Stopped(DebugStop), Exited(status: u32), Killed(signal: u32)
 struct DebugEvent                     thread: u64, change: DebugChange
 struct DebugSignal                    signal: u32, code: i32, address: u64 (the faulting address; 0 when not a fault)
```

A debugger's control of another process, for the debug server a development machine runs. attach stops every thread of the process and holds it, and a thread it starts later is held too; memory writes reach read-only code, as a breakpoint needs. registers are laid out as a crash report's, x0-x30, sp, pc, pstate on arm64. The debug port is the machine's line to the host debugger (a virtio console port named tessera.debug on a development VM). Entitlement tessera.debug.attach, on a debug image only; the system's own programs hold it, and init starts the debug server only when the boot line has tessera.dev.

### 20.3 System information

```
 enum InfoTopic (for System.info): UInt32          Version = 0, Machine = 1, Backend =
 2, Device = 3, Limits = 4, Session = 5
```

```
 System.info(topic: InfoTopic, version: UInt32, out: Buffer) -> Result<Size,

Synchronous (shared read-only page mapped at init). System.info is the only place a consumer learns the page size, the backend kind, or the device class; it must never infer them.

## 21. Kernel backends

LibTessera is one portable front (everything above) plus one backend per kernel. The backend is the only code that knows a kernel exists: ~15 % of the library by size, replaceable as a unit. Its contract is the object semantics in §3–20; the tables below show each backend satisfies them.

### 21.1 Linux backend mapping

The table is the draft's. This tree's backend does not use io_uring: a port is
an in-process queue, and `Port.wait` advances every pending operation and sleeps
in `ppoll` on the descriptors they wait on (§25).

```
 Object / call       Linux mechanism

```
 Handle table        in-process table {fd or pointer, type, rights, generation}; fds are

Added by entitlement: tessera.network.* → socket (AF_INET/AF_INET6, protocol by entitlement), bind, listen, accept4, connect, setsockopt, sendmmsg, recvmmsg, getsockname, getpeername; tessera.jit → mprotect(PROT_EXEC) with PROT_WRITE; tessera.driver → ioctl on the DRM/device fds; tessera.thread.realtime → SCHED_DEADLINE. Everything path-based (open, openat, openat2, unlink*, rename*, mkdir*, getdents64, chdir, readlink*, execve*, mount, …) is never in an app's filter.

The Linux row for in-process handle rights is the one place enforcement is advisory; it is safe because every right that matters across a trust boundary (file access, network, devices, other processes) is backed by a kernel object or a service that re-checks. The BackendInfo.KERNEL_RIGHTS bit reports when a backend enforces handle rights in the kernel, for tooling.

### 21.5 The kernel-specific residue

Everything a port of LibTessera to a new kernel must write: the entry stub and syscall trampolines per architecture; the handle-table adapter; the twelve object implementations in §21.1; the sandbox generator; the executable-format TLS template reader; and the four service back-halves that touch hardware (Namespace, Devices, Power, Display). Nothing above the backend boundary — no struct, no call, no error, no protocol — changes. DeviceKit (§17) is rewritten per kernel as well, outside LibTessera.

## 22. Consumers

### 22.1 Kira programs

A Kira program links `LibTessera.framework/LibTessera` dynamically, found at
run time through its run path `/System/Library/Frameworks/LibTessera.framework`,
and calls LibTessera with `import LibTessera`: Kira reads `LibTessera.ridl` in
the SDK in place (KLF-RIDL §27.7, [18](18-components.md)).

### 22.2 Other languages

Through bindings generated from the same RIDL surface. There is no C header and
no C standard library on top of LibTessera. A Rust std port would bind the
surface the same way; the table below is what its sys layer calls.

| Rust std | LibTessera |
|---|---|
| `alloc::System` | `Memory.reserve`, `Memory.map`, `Memory.commit`, `Memory.decommit` |
| `thread::spawn`, `park`, `sleep`, `yield_now` | `Thread.spawn`, `Sync.wait32`, `Sync.wake`, `Thread.sleep`, `Thread.yield` |
| `Mutex`, `RwLock`, `Condvar`, `Once` | `Sync.wait32`, `Sync.wake`, `Sync.requeue` |
| `thread_local!` | `Thread.tlsBase`, `Thread.setTlsBase` |
| `Instant`, `SystemTime` | `Time.read(Monotonic)`, `Time.read(Realtime)` |
| `fs::File::open`, `create` | `Node.lookup` or `Node.create` beneath a directory, then `File.open` |
| `Read`, `Write`, `Seek` | `File.read`, `File.write` with an offset kept by the caller |
| `read_dir`, `metadata`, `remove_*`, `rename`, `create_dir` | `Node.list`, `Node.info`, `Node.delete`, `Node.rename`, `Node.create` |
| `canonicalize` | not available; `Node.displayPath` is for display only |
| `env::args`, `env::var` | the launch arguments; there are no environment variables |
| `net::*` | `Endpoint.*`; name resolution over `tessera.resolver` with `Channel.call` |
| `process::Command`, `Child::wait` | `Process.launch`; `Object.waitAsync(TERMINATED)` and `ProcessInfo` |
| `process::exit`, `abort` | `Process.exit` |
| `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr` | the StdIn, StdOut and StdErr startup handles |
| `RandomState` | `Random.fill` |

### 22.3 Frameworks

KiraUI and KCoreSurface reach MosaicDisplay through `tessera.display` channels.
Ember reaches the GPU through DeviceKit, not
LibTessera (§17). Kira's crypto framework sits on
`Random.fill`.

## 24. Decisions still open

1. Sync-mode convenience. This draft has no synchronous variants at all (thread-port convention). It is the cleanest, but every trivial stat from Rust std costs a Port.wait. Alternative: a TESSERA_PORT_SYNC sentinel that blocks in place. I recommend keeping it pure and measuring.
1. Node info snapshot. Object.info(node,.Node) returns a cached snapshot; is a possibly-stale sync path acceptable, or should Node info be async-only?
1. Case sensitivity in user-visible locations. Draft says case-sensitive/ preserving with a service-level collision policy. Apple-style case-insensitive would be friendlier to users and worse for ports.
1. Trash semantics. DeleteOptions.Permanent defers to a per-volume policy the user controls. Confirm that Tessera wants a system trash at all (the immutable-system + container model doesn't require one).

1. Job vs "Session". I used Job (Zircon term). If Tessera wants its own word (Realm, Cell), it's a rename only.
1. Camera as a Stream. Camera frames fit the stream model; the camera control surface (Stream.control requests) will be large. If the settled camera scheme wants its own service protocol, Stream stays for frames only.
1. Endpoint.sendMany datagram struct — 56 bytes with an inline NetAddress; could shrink to a pointer if QUIC stacks prefer their own layout.
1. RISC-V. The store mandate means MachineInfo.arch includes RiscV64 and the entry stub/TLS/syscall residue exists for it; nothing else in this document is architecture-specific.

## 25. This implementation

`libtessera` implements every call in §23 on Linux. Devices (§16) and Power
(§18) are answered by the `tessera.devices` and `tessera.power` services
(25.4). Every other call runs inside the calling process. Where the draft
routes such a call through a service, the library does what that service
would and enforces the same entitlements. Only `app/Backend/Linux/` knows
the kernel (§21): it alone declares system calls (`@FFI.Syscall`) and holds
the kernel's numbers, paths and layouts, and the rest of the library calls
it by what it does. No other Tessera program declares a system call or
imports a kernel package. Another kernel is another backend folder.

### 25.1 Engine

- A port is an in-process queue. `Port.wait` advances the port's pending operations, then sleeps in `ppoll` on their descriptors until one is ready or the deadline passes. State in shared memory (events) has no descriptor and is looked at again every 10 ms.
- Objects that cross processes are descriptors: memfds for Memory and events; `SOCK_SEQPACKET` pairs for channels; pidfds for processes; cgroup v2 directories for jobs. PID 1 mounts the hierarchy at `/sys/fs/cgroup`.
- A channel message is an 8-byte prefix (`u32` handle count, `u32` reserved), one 48-byte record per handle, then the payload. Descriptors travel as `SCM_RIGHTS` in record order.
- `Channel.call` takes its response handles as a `Buffer` of `Handle` values, since RIDL has no out-array.
- An entitlement value of `*` holds every entitlement.

### 25.2 Departures from the draft

- `Thread.spawn`, `Thread.tlsBase` and `Thread.setTlsBase` answer `Unsupported`. A new thread has to start on a stack its parent built, and Kira has no way to call an address or read the thread register. Every other thread call works on the calling thread.
- Grants, pickers and authorization: there is no Presence service and no process holds a Presence handle, so the calls that take one fail `NotMainProcess` in `Presence`, and the calls that name a grant fail `NotFound`.
- `WakeLock.acquire(Display)` completes `Unsupported` in `Display` until MosaicDisplay owns blanking. A Cpu, Audio or Network lock is a connection to `tessera.power`, which holds a DeviceKit wake source for as long as the connection is open and closes it when the timeout passes. The WakeLock then asserts `PEER_CLOSED`.
- `Crash.setReporter` answers `Unsupported` in `Audit` after its checks. The system's crash reporter, `reportcrash`, takes every process's fault from the kernel and writes its report to `/data/system/DiagnosticReports` (14-tooling-and-ports.md), but nothing yet hands a report to a channel a process registered.
- `Power.scheduleWake` is a `CLOCK_BOOTTIME_ALARM` timer owned by the calling process and does not outlive it. The library also asks `tessera.power` to arm the RTC alarm for the same moment, so the system wakes from suspend for it.
- `StreamFormat` is one flat struct with a field per stream class. `Endpoint.sendMany` and `Endpoint.receiveMany` take a `Buffer` of 56-byte `Datagram` records.
- A device id is `(class + 1) << 48 | local`. The local part is `card << 8 | device` for audio, the `videoN` number for a camera, `n << 8 | kind` for a sensor on `iio:deviceN`, and the `eventN` number for a haptic device. `tessera.devices` drives them through DeviceKit's Audio, Camera, Sensor and Haptic families. It mixes nothing: an audio output stream is one open PCM, and a second stream on the same output fails `Busy`.
- `Log.write` goes to `/dev/kmsg` (standard error when it cannot be opened). Trace events go to `/sys/kernel/tracing/trace_marker`.
- `System.info(Version)` reports LibTessera's CalVer and ABI as the OS version until the image carries its own.

### 25.3 Kernel

`kernel/config/tessera-common.config` turns on what the library reaches: cgroup
v2 with the memory, pids and cpu controllers, wakeup sources and the tracer.

### 25.4 Services

Services are reached through a broker, the `bootstrap` program, which
init starts before any other. It listens on the abstract `AF_UNIX`
`SOCK_SEQPACKET` socket `tessera.system`. No service has a socket name of
its own, so a service is reachable only through the broker.

- A service calls `serviceListen(name)`. That checks in with the broker,
  which allows it only to the program its table names for `name`, for
  example `/bin/power` for `tessera.power`. The check-in connection
  stays open as the listener. When the broker goes away, the listener
  checks in again with the broker init restarts.
- Every other process holds a System channel: one connection to the
  broker, made the first time it asks for a service and kept while it
  runs. Its messages are Channel messages with the §10.3 header, and
  `connectService` and `listServices` are calls on it like any other
  call, matched to their answers by transaction id. The broker tells the
  two kinds of connection apart by the first message: a Channel message
  starts with its handle count, 0 here, and a check-in starts with its
  op, which is never 0. When the broker goes away, the next call
  reconnects once, waiting for the broker init restarts.
- A client calls `serviceConnect(name)`, which is
  `System.connectService` on its System channel. The broker makes a
  channel with `Channel.create`. It hands one end
  to the client, as the answer's one Channel handle, and sends the other
  down the service's check-in connection, with the client's program. The service takes it with
  `serviceAccept`. A client that asks before the service has checked in
  waits up to ten seconds, so the order in which init starts services
  does not matter. An unknown name is `NotFound`. A missing entitlement is
  `NotEntitled`. A service that does not check in in time is `Timeout`.
- `serviceList(out)` is `listServices`, whose answer is the §12
  `Vector<ServiceInfo>`. The library lays it out as one 160-byte record
  per service: the name, then the entitlement a client needs, or nothing.
- `serviceNotify(listener, method, body, entitlement)` posts an event. The
  service sends it up its check-in connection, and the broker sends it,
  with `flags.EVENT` and no transaction, on the System channel of every
  process that holds `entitlement`. The Devices service posts
  `deviceChanged` this way when a registry watch sees an audio endpoint,
  a camera or a haptic device come or go, as Core Audio tells its
  listeners that the device list changed.
  The Volume service posts `volumeChanged` with no entitlement, as
  NSWorkspace posts didMount and didUnmount to every application. The
  broker's table names the events each service may post, and drops any
  other, so only the Devices service can say a device came or went.
- A process reads its events from `startupHandle(startupSystem())` with
  `Channel.read`. The library connects the channel when it is first asked
  for it and sends `System/attach`, so the broker knows the connection
  for one before the process has called anything on it. A call keeps
  every message that is not its answer for `Channel.read`, even before
  the process holds the handle, so an event that comes during its first
  calls is not lost; the oldest of more than 64 goes. When the broker goes, `Channel.read` answers
  `PeerClosed`; asking for the handle again gives the same handle on a
  new connection to the broker init restarts. The restart boot asserts
  that the platform does so.
- `servicePeerProgram` names the client's program as the broker reported
  it. For a channel the broker did not make, it reads `SO_PEERCRED` and
  `/proc/<pid>/exe`.

The broker is an ordinary LibTessera program. It holds the entitlement
`tessera.broker`, which grants four calls of this implementation's own:
`brokerListen` starts listening where services and System channels reach
it, `brokerAccept` takes the next connection as a Channel with the
program at the other end, `brokerReceive` reads a message and says whether
it is a Channel message or a check-in, and `brokerSend` answers a service
on the check-in wire with at most one Channel. It answers a System channel
with `Channel.write`, waits on every connection with `Ref.waitAsync`, and
never sees how either kind of message is framed.

A connection is an ordinary Channel, with the framing of 25.1, so handles
cross it. These calls are this implementation's own and are not in §23.
Departures from §12: the System channel is not handed over in the
Startup message under tag 1. The library connects it itself, as the
Launcher that would mint it does not exist yet, and the broker knows the
process by `SO_PEERCRED` rather than by an identity the Launcher wrote.
`System/attach` is this implementation's own method and stands in for the
handover. Of the events only `deviceChanged`, `volumeChanged` and
`timeChanged` are sent, and `deviceChanged` not for sensors, since listing
them opens every IIO device. The Volume service posts `volumeChanged` when
it mounts or unmounts a volume after its first scan. The Power service
posts `timeChanged`, with no entitlement, as macOS posts
NSSystemClockDidChangeNotification: every tick, at least every two
seconds, it compares Realtime less Monotonic with the last tick's, and a
change of more than a second means the clock was set. The body is
`RealtimeDetails` with the new offset, `synchronised` 0, the monotonic
instant it saw the change as `lastSet`, and no error bound. The `date`
system tool, after macOS's, sets the clock with the kernel's own call, as
no application may set it; the multi boot runs `date 010100002030` and
asserts that the platform hears the clock was set to 2030. A process that forks connects its own, as the
broker judges by the program at the other end. The broker's table of
services is in its source, not in manifests.
`tessera.volume` needs the entitlement `tessera.volume`, which is this
implementation's own entitlement, as a sandboxed Mac app cannot look up
`diskarbitrationd`.

A service decides entitlements from the connecting program, since the
image carries no signed entitlements yet. A program under `/bin` is part of
the system and holds every entitlement. Any other program holds the
defaults. The library still checks the caller's own entitlements before it
asks, so the service's check is the one the caller cannot skip.

The `devices` and `power` services share one wire. Each message starts
with a 32-byte header: `op` @0, `code` @4 (an `ErrorCode`, 0 for success),
then `a` @8, `b` @16 and `c` @24. The operation's bytes follow. An answer
carries the request's `op`.

- Devices: 1 `List` (`a` the class; the answer is one 184-byte record per device), 2 `Open` (a 96-byte `StreamDescriptor`; the answer is the negotiated descriptor and one Memory handle per slot), 3 `Enqueue`, 4 `Start`, 5 `Stop`, 6 `Flush`, 7 `Reconfigure`, 8 `Control`, 9 `Info`, and 16 `Done`, which the service sends when it returns a slot. A stream is one connection: closing it closes the stream.
- Power: 1 `Page` (the answer carries a Memory handle to a 4096-byte `PowerInfo` page that every client maps read-only and reads under a sequence count), 2 `WakeLock` and 3 `ScheduleWake`.

`tessera.volume` is the third service. It answers 1 `List` with the disks
and partitions DeviceKit finds, what each holds and where it is mounted:
it mounts every file system it finds at `/Volumes/<label>`, `noexec`,
`nodev` and `nosuid`, read-only when the device is. It watches the
registry, so a disk attached later is mounted as it arrives, and one pulled
out is unmounted and forgotten. 2 `Mount`, 3 `Unmount`
and 4 `Eject` name a volume by its registry entry in `a`, as
DADiskMount, DADiskUnmount and DADiskEject do on macOS. `Mount` answers
the mount point. `Eject` unmounts every volume on the volume's disk and
leaves the disk out of the list until the service starts again. Only mounts
under `/Volumes` are the service's to undo: anything else is
`AccessDenied`, and a mount in use is `Busy`. 5 `Watch` keeps the
connection open: the service sends every volume as `Appeared` (`a` 1),
then `Idle` (4), and from then on one message per change, each the header
with the kind in `a` and the volume's `List` record. A volume that comes
is `Appeared` unmounted, then `DescriptionChanged` (3) with its mount
point; an unmount is `DescriptionChanged` too, and a volume ejected or
pulled out is `Disappeared` (2). These are DiskArbitration's
DARegisterDiskAppearedCallback, DARegisterDiskDescriptionChangedCallback,
DARegisterDiskDisappearedCallback and DARegisterIdleCallback. No
LibTessera call reaches the service yet; `diskutil` is its client.

### 25.5 The machine, and the backend seam

PID 1 and the system services need a few things no application does. They
are calls of this implementation's own, not in §23, and each says what is
wanted rather than how a kernel does it.

- The machine. `machinePrepare` makes the machine ready for a userland; on Linux that mounts `/proc`, `/sys`, the cgroup v2 hierarchy, `/dev`, `/tmp` and `/run`, and an empty in-memory `/Volumes` when the root has one, since a sealed root cannot hold the mount points the Volume service makes there. `machineQuietConsole` keeps all but critical kernel messages off the console. `machineFlush` writes everything waiting to every volume, and `machineStop(PowerOff | Restart)` flushes and stops. `machineEnterRoot(path)` makes the volume mounted at `path` the root of the caller and of everything it starts after. All need `tessera.machine`.
- Volumes. `volumeMount(source, target, format, options)` mounts a disk holding a `VolumeFormat` (Ext4, Btrfs, Fat, Erofs, Squashfs), or with `Bind` or `Move` a directory, with the options `ReadOnly`, `NoExecute`, `NoDevices` and `NoSetIdentity`. `volumeUnmount(target, Detach?)` undoes it. `volumeDisks` names the machine's disks and `volumeMounts` lists what is mounted. These need `tessera.machine` too, which the Volume service holds as a program under `/bin`. A btrfs volume's subvolumes ([05](05-storage-and-state.md)): `volumeMountSubvolume(source, target, subvolume, options)` mounts the subvolume at the path `subvolume` inside the btrfs on `source`; `volumeCreateSubvolume(path)` makes an empty subvolume at `path`; `volumeSnapshot(source, target, ReadOnly?)` makes the subvolume `target` a snapshot of the subvolume `source`, read-only when asked; `volumeDeleteSubvolume(path)` deletes the subvolume at `path` and everything in it. Each needs `tessera.machine`. `VolumeLayout` names the paths inside the volume: `boot/current`, `system/<version>`, `system/dev` and `data`.
- The first process. `processWatchSystem(port, key)` posts a completion when the machine is asked to stop, when someone asks for its attention (Ctrl-Alt-Del), or when a child ends, and `processSystemEvents` says which. `processReapOrphans` collects the processes the kernel gave PID 1. `processReplace(path, arguments)` replaces the caller with a program, taking its arguments as a `LaunchInfo` Memory handle like `Process.launch`. `processAskToStop` asks a process to stop, which the process hears through `processWatchTermination`. `timeSetRealtime` sets the wall clock, which `date` needs.
- The backend seam. DeviceKit's backend and devicekitd are rewritten for each kernel ([17](17-devicekit.md) §20.4). They make no system call of their own: they ask the library's backend through the `backend*` calls, which take and answer the backend's own object numbers and layouts, as `Port.attachSource` takes the backend's number for an object. 17 §25 lists them.

The library implements these in `app/Backend/Linux/` like everything else
it does, so a program that uses them survives a change of kernel; only
DeviceKit's backend and devicekitd are rewritten with the backend.
