# Tessera

Tessera is an operating system built on the Linux kernel, with a userland
written entirely in [Kira](https://github.com/kira-lang-com/kira).

Tessera provides its own init, service broker, display server, UI toolkit,
system services and applications, designed together as one system. Components
communicate through typed RIDL contracts, graphics run on Vulkan, and the
system image is a sealed, read-only volume kept separate from installed
applications and user data.

This repository contains every Tessera component, from PID 1 to the apps.


## Features

- **Kira userland.** Every system component is written in Kira. The developer
  SDK consists of Kira, RIDL and Vulkan.
- **RIDL IPC.** Services and applications communicate only through typed RIDL
  contracts, brokered by `bootstrap`.
- **MosaicDisplay.** A GPU display server handling surfaces, composition, input
  routing and frame pacing.
- **Dynamic Platforms.** Adaptive Desktop, Adaptive Mobile, Console and Media
  run on the same OS and share PlatformKit.
- **Vulkan graphics.** Rendering goes through Ember on Vulkan across the stack.
- **Sealed system volume.** The system image is a read-only squashfs volume;
  applications and data live on a separate writable volume.
- **aarch64 and x86_64.** aarch64 is the primary architecture; x86_64 is
  supported alongside it.

## Building

Requirements: the [Kira](https://github.com/kira-lang-com/kira) toolchain and
its LLVM bundle. Cross builds also require a target sysroot. See
[tessera/](tessera/) for full setup instructions.

**Windows** (builds inside a Fedora WSL2 distribution):

```powershell
.\tessera\tessera.ps1 boot -arch x86_64 -test    # build, boot, verify userland starts
.\tessera\tessera.ps1 boot -arch x86_64 -dev     # boot interactively
```

**macOS** (aarch64):

```sh
cd tessera
kira build boot -arch aarch64 -test              # build changed components, boot, verify
kira build boot -arch aarch64 -desktop           # boot to the desktop in a window
```

Tessera currently targets Linux 7.2 (mainline).


## Status

Tessera boots to its desktop and runs applications. The full path through the
system is in place: system calls, process supervision, IPC, GPU composition,
text rendering, the UI toolkit, and a desktop that launches applications. Data
written in Notes persists across reboots on an installed system.

Planned work includes Home and personalisation, an App Store, networking,
audio, power management, additional applications, accessibility, backups, and
the security and confinement model for third-party applications.

See [tessera/ROADMAP.md](tessera/ROADMAP.md) and its 38 chapters in
[tessera/roadmap/](tessera/roadmap/) for details.


## Contributing

Read [tessera/AGENTS.md](tessera/AGENTS.md) before contributing. It covers the
repository layout, verification, and how changes are reviewed and landed.

Key rules: all code is written in Kira, components communicate only through
RIDL, and WebKit WPE (used by the browser) is the only foreign engine.
